When he told me the news, he knew his odds were not good. Robin was a realist. On the phone later, he cried and told me he loved me like a sister though he acknowledged that he rarely talked to his own sister. I cried, too. A week later, I told him about my own cancer diagnosis, and from then on, we didn't talk much about politics. Instead, we compared radiation notes and made inappropriate jokes about death and cancer that we couldn't make with anyone else. Mostly we just talked about life, which suddenly seemed so much shorter.
Governor Scott personally ensured that Robin got the best medical care, for which he was grateful. But even so, his prognosis and ordeal were much worse than mine. Over the summer, he had surgery to remove part of his esophagus and stomach. He was connected to a feeding tube for months and denied the small pleasure of a good meal. Even so, he maintained a sense of humor and, much to my surprise, continued to worry about how I was doing. He texted me almost the moment I got home from the hospital after surgery. Robin checked in on me more than anyone else, including my parents, even though he was far sicker and more miserable than I was.
In September, Robin was able to shed the feeding tube just in time to jump into his new camper and evacuate for Hurricane Irma. I demanded regular updates, which he sent from the road. Fortunately, his house was spared. Once he got home, he was back on Facebook, denouncing the pantywaists  *** ing about the power company's work after the storm
Hurricane Irma hit on Sunday, September 10. It is now four soon to be five days later and people are pissing and moaning about not having electric. Suck it up buttercup!! Do you have any idea what these lineman are dealing with? Do you have any idea the conditions they are working in? They come from all over this great country. Many have never experienced this heat, humidity, mosquitoes before. When we had hurricane Charley we were without electric for 14 days. No one complained. You know why? Most of the people had no roofs!! So if you have a home to go back to, if your home did not flood, if you did not lose everything, then STFU!
I was glad to see the fire had returned after his long summer struggle, which included radiation and chemotherapy treatments. Things seemed to be looking up for him. But about a month later, Robin came down with pneumonia, and while in the hospital, a scan showed that the cancer had spread to his liver. On November 17, he wrote to me, œI want you to be one of the first to know that I am terminal.
He was devastated and especially worried about his family, particularly his wife Greta, a school speech pathologist to whom he'd been married and devoted for 35 years. Doctors would try immunotherapy, but the best-case scenario was that he'd get another 12 months; worst case, three or four. I asked if he had a bucket list. He didn't. He only wanted to take his family to West Virginia to show them where to sprinkle his ashes. He told me he didn't want a memorial service. I objected, suggesting he do it open mic-style, like the tea party rallies, and I told him I would come and bring my lawn chair like the old people. œYou could, he replied. œOf course you could use mine. I don't need it.
I hoped to make it to Florida to see him, but as it turned out, he lasted barely a month. I last chatted with him the week after Thanksgiving, when he wasn't able to eat anything because of his condition. And then, on Tuesday morning, I had a bad feeling. I realized that with all the chaos of the holiday season, I hadn't checked in on Robin in two weeks, and he hadn't contacted me, which was unusual. I went to Facebook to send him a message and discovered that he had died a couple of hours earlier.
A Kenyan court ruled Thursday the use of **** examinations to determine a suspect's assass orientation is legal, despite arguments that the procedure is a form of torture.
Mombasa High Court Judge Mathew Emukule said, œI find no violation of human dignity, right to privacy and right to freedom of the petitioners," the associated Press reported.
The court in Mombasa made the decision after reviewing the case of two men who were arrested in a bar near Ukunda along Kenya's Indian Ocean coast in Feburary 2015 on suspicion of having ass.
In Kenya, ***is a criminal offense and can bring prison sentences of up to 14 years.
The two men were forced to have **** examinations and HIV and Hepatitis B tests, and they petitioned that they were being "subjected to torture and degrading treatment," the AP reported.
A judge dismissed their petition Thursday. The men still face charges.
Cameroon, Egypt, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, Uganda and Zambia are other countries that still use **** exams to determine homoassassass, the Washington Post reported.
I was not in the ranks of the women who asked for admittance to the Priesthood Session of conference, but I support them, and I think the work that they are doing to spur a real discussion of the ad-hoc œdoctrine of gender we have adopted in this church is immensely needed and valuable. While I may not strictly nor perfectly œshare their views, as you put it, I do not at all find what they are doing to be divisive. They are, perhaps, highlighting an existing divide. There are more women in this church who are hurt, confused, and disaffected by the state of its gender-based policies than your comments suppose, and while you perhaps feel that you were gracious in offering acceptance and a hope for peace to these others, I find your statement contains a very serious error of presupposition.
The women of Ordain Women and those who support them and appreciate their efforts are not a small œother to be urged to remain among us, among some majority who have the privilege to define the whole.
They are us.
They are the Body of Christ as we are. And while different women in the church have different life experiences, and different focuses on addressing even the pains that we do share, we are all the Body of Christ. The Ordain Women are representative, and not just a small group to be tacitly dismissed as divisive, and wished well.
I say again, they are representative. Not of each and every one of the women in the church, certainly, because we are not a monolithic entity with all the same lives, inclinations, experiences, talents, natures, or desires. But they do represent something significant within the Body of Christ, something that requires acknowledgment, and not platitudes and spoken reassurances. Something that deserves a place at the table as it is, and recognition from the membership without fear that it is some kind of threat. It is something that deserves to be known, as Christ truly knows us all, and not painted with straw-man caricature from the pulpit, as has so regrettably happened in this and other General Conferences.
I did not participate with Ordain Women because my own personal focus is elsewhere at the moment, but they have my full love and support, and I do not find them divisive. I find them inspiring and brave, putting their own faces and selves under scrutiny to give a face and voice to a pain and a desire that cannot be be ignored, nor washed away by the blood of Christ, because it is not a sin. If that is divisive, then the fault lies elsewhere, and betrays significant weaknesses in the unity of this body, and its ability to accept all of its disparate parts for what they are. I would hope that those who claim to speak for God, and those who speak for those who claim to speak for God, can recognize that, and see the true faces of these sisters, and what they represent, and give that the weight and acknowledgment that it deserves. I hope that we can wish them, not only a place within the love of our Savior, but a place in all of our hearts and minds, and a place at our table, where they can speak, tell their stories, and truly be heard as He would hear them, and not as heard by mortal ears that filter with fear, an us-vs-them perspective, or an insularity of self.
These sisters have something important to say. They have, and do feel Christ's love, I assure you, and it is from that, that they draw their strength to make themselves seen and heard. It is now up to the mortal group to see past its own limitations, and truly hear them as well.
Sincerely,
Melissa Mayhew

Tokyo (AFP) Nov 29, 2014
Japan on Monday will launch a space probe on a six-year mission to mine a distant asteroid after the event was postponed due to bad weather, officials said.
Hayabusa2 is now scheduled to blast off aboard Japan's main H-IIA rocket from Tanegashima Space Center in southern Japan at 1:22 pm (0422 GMT), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency said Saturday.
The agency had originally planned to launch the rocket on Sunday only weeks after a European spacecraft's historic landing on a comet captivated the world's attention.
But a forecast of thick cloud over the weekend forced the agency to delay the launch.
The 31 billion yen ($260 million) project is sending a probe towards the unpoetically-named 1999 JU3 asteroid in deep space.
It will blast a crater in the asteroid to collect virgin materials unexposed to millennia of solar wind and radiation, in the hope of answering some fundamental questions about life and the universe.
Hayabusa2, about the size of a domestic refrigerator, is expected to reach the asteroid in mid-2018 and will spend around 18 months studying the surface.
Bad weather delays Japan asteroid probe lift off
Tokyo (AFP) Nov 28, 2014 - Bad weather will delay the launch of a Japanese space probe on a six-year mission to mine a distant asteroid, just weeks after a European spacecraft's historic landing on a comet captivated the world.
Hayabusa2 had been set to blast off aboard Japan's main H-IIA rocket from Tanegashima Space Center in southern Japan on Sunday.
But thick cloud expected over the weekend means scientists need to postpone the launch, a statement by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) said.
"The new launch day will be announced as soon as it is determined," it added.
The 31 billion yen ($260 million) project is sending a probe towards the unpoetically-named 1999 JU3 asteroid in deep space.
It will blast a crater in the asteroid to collect virgin materials unexposed to millennia of solar wind and radiation, in the hope of answering some fundamental questions about life and the universe.
"The asteroid is carbonaceous and we may find organic matter and water, the stuff of life," Hitoshi Kuninaka, project leader at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), said in an interview posted on the agency's website.
****ysing the extra-terrestrial materials could help shed light on the birth of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago and offer clues about what gave rise to life on Earth, he said.
Hayabusa2, about the size of a domestic refrigerator, is expected to reach the asteroid in mid-2018 and will spend around 18 months studying the surface.
It will also drop tiny MINERVA-II rover robots as well as a French-German landing package named Mobile Asteroid Surface Scout (MASCOT) for surface observation.
- Galactic first -
In a galactic first, Hayabusa2 will drop an "impactor" that will explode above the asteroid's surface and fire a metal bullet into the crust at a speed of 7,200 kilometres (4,500 miles) an hour -- six times the speed of sound on Earth.
The bullet is expected to create a small crater that will enable the probe to collect material from the asteroid.
"The impactor is made fully with Japanese technologies that are so advanced you would think they are out of this world," said Kuninaka.
The Hayabusa2 mission will blast off just weeks after the European Space Agency succeeded in making mankind's first-ever landing on a comet this month.
Scientists said initial data sent from the robot lab Philae showed traces of organic molecules and a surface much harder than imagined.
Philae, released from its mothership Rosetta, has gone into hibernation on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, having used its onboard battery power after 60 hours of prodding and probing.
Engineers hope the lander's solar panels will charge its batteries in the coming months as the comet, with Philae hopefully still clinging to its surface, moves closer to the Sun.
If the Hayabusa2 mission goes well, pristine asteroid samples will be returned to Earth in late 2020.
JAXA aims to bring 100 milligrammes (1/286th of an ounce) of samples to Earth after a round trip of more than five billion kilometres.
The probe is the successor to JAXA's first asteroid explorer, Hayabusa -- the Japanese term for falcon -- which returned to Earth in 2010 with dust samples after a trouble-plagued seven-year mission.
The spherical 1999 JU3 asteroid, which is around a kilometre (half a mile) across, is believed to contain significantly more organic matter and water than the potato-shaped rock studied by the original Hayabusa.
Time Magazine should be ashamed for giving new life to a horrendous blood libel accusing the IDF of stealing Palestinian organs.
In the middle of a video about the Israeli military, we are told that the œIDF is not without controversy.
Their example?
.in 2009 a Swedish report came out exposing some Israeli troops of selling organs of Palestinians who died in their custody.
(Around the 1:15 mark of the video.)
The reference is to a completely made up tabloid style article in an obscure Swedish paper, that even the author admitted was not based on any evidence.
Here is what we said after it was published back in 2009
Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet's August 2009 story accusing the IDF of harvesting Palestinian organs caused an uproar. Donald Bostrom, the author of the offensive piece, duly demonstrated his utter lack of any basic journalistic standards when he said: œBut whether it's true or not “ I have no idea, I have no clue. On top of this, the story was further undermined as one of the Palestinian families interviewed said they never told any reporter that their son was missing organs.
Mission May 2019
Unfortunately, we also wrote at the time that despite the author's own admission that he had no evidence to back up his horrendous accusation, the story would continue spreading.
With the credibility of the story in tatters one might have expected the outrageous accusations to have a limited shelf life or to disappear altogether. However, the Swedish blood libel is a textbook case study of how what starts as an article published in a language read by few from a country of limited international influence can turn into a poison that spreads much wider.
Like other œBig Lies about Israel such as the Jenin œMassacre and the Al Dura video, the story about Israeli soldiers stealing Palestinian organs is one that just won't die. But it is still astonishing that an institution such as Time Magazine would refer to this blood libel as fact and even add to it by showing recent footage of an Israeli attack on Gaza taken completely out of context.
Time suggests that readers should send comments to the email address feedback@time.com. We urge you to do so and demand that they take down and apologize for this outrageous journalistic fail.

Sam, a seventh-round draft choice, had been battling undrafted rookie Ethan Westbrooks for a final roster spot. Westbrooks was one of nine defensive linemen to make the team.
Sam thanked the Rams for the opportunity in a series of tweets after the team made the announcement.
I want to thank the entire Rams organization and the city of St. Louis for giving me this tremendous opportunity and allowing me to (1/2) - Michael Sam (@MichaelSamNFL) August 30, 2014
show I can play at this level. I look forward to continuing to build on the progress I made here toward a long and successful career (2/2) - Michael Sam (@MichaelSamNFL) August 30, 2014
The most worthwhile things in life rarely come easy, this is a lesson I've always known. The journey continues. - Michael Sam (@MichaelSamNFL) August 30, 2014
Sam officially hit waivers Saturday at 4 p.m. ET when all NFL teams had to trim their rosters to the league-mandated 53 players. From there, the other 31 teams will have until noon ET on Sunday to put in a claim for Sam. If he goes unclaimed, he will be free to sign with a practice squad.
A league source said earlier this week that the Rams would like to bring Sam back to their 10-man practice squad, but Fisher fended off questions about any potential moves Saturday, saying the practice squad will be affected by the team's needs at other positions.
Editor's Picks Wagoner: Rams make football decision, cut Sam Ultimately, the Rams decision to cut Michael Sam came down to his football skills. He was good, but nine other defensive lineman were better, Nick Wagoner writes.
"There will be no challenge, no challenges whatsoever," for whatever team picks up Sam, Rams coach Jeff Fisher said at a news conference Saturday.
"There's no challenge with respect to Mike Sam. He's not about drawing attention to himself. He kept his head down and worked and you can't ask anything more out of any player for that matter."
Fisher repeated over and over that it was purely a football decision.
"I will tell you this: I was pulling for Mike," he said. "I really was, and I don't say that very often. Mike came in here and did everything we asked him to do."
The coach personally delivered the news to all of the cuts, except for Sam, who attended Missouri's opener in Columbia, a 1Â½-hour drive west on I-70 from Rams Park, and learned via cell phone. He was introduced to the crowd in the end zone alongside cornerback E.J. Gaines, a sixth-round pick who made the team.
Sam blew a kiss and waved to the crowd, then walked back to the sideline. He posed for a few pictures then started looking at his phone and headed for the locker room.
Fisher plans to meet with Sam on Sunday.
"He said 'Yes sir,' and he said, 'I understand.' He said, 'Thanks for the opportunity,' and I said, 'Mike, I'm looking forward to visiting with you tomorrow,' and he goes, 'I am, too,' " Fisher said of their phone conversation.
Jason Collins, who became the first openly *** athlete in North America's four major professional sports when he signed with the NBA's Brooklyn Nets in late February, tweeted out his support for Sam.
Sometimes in life you have to take the long road to get to your destination. @MichaelSamNFL can & will help a @nfl team win games. #workhard - Jason Collins (@jasoncollins98) August 30, 2014
Former tennis great Billie Jean King, who is openly ass, called Sam "remarkable" despite being cut.
"Michael Sam's quest to play in the NFL may have hit a roadblock today, but he may not be out of the game," she told ESPN's LZ Granderson. "This is a football issue and not about his assass orientation. Some have said he can play in the NFL and hopefully another team will pick him up. What he has already done for the LGBT community is remarkable and I don't think we have seen the last of Michael Sam."
The Rams spent a seventh-round draft pick, No. 249 overall, on Sam in May's draft. He put together a solid preseason performance, coming up with 11 tackles and three sacks. In Thursday night's preseason finale against Miami, Sam finished his preseason work with a team-high six tackles.

After the game, Fisher offered an endorsement of Sam's ability.
"I believe he can play in this league," Fisher said.
Fans sure believed so: Sam had the seventh-best selling jersey on NFLShop.com, the league's official store, from April 1 through July 31.
Sam came out following his final season at Missouri, though he had told his teammates before it began. The Tigers went on to tie a school record with 12 wins. Sam had 11Â½ sacks and the lightly-regarded Tigers won the SEC Eastern Division, a huge step forward after going 5-7 during the first season in their new conference.
"If you look at our season, it didn't hurt us at all," Gaines recalled.
In 2016, the Obama administration approved a redesign of the U.S. $20 bill that would replace seventh U.S. president Andrew Jackson with the African American abolitionist and underground railroad conductor. The new design is to take effect in 2020.

Mars will be visible throughout the night as it traverses across the sky from east to west. (Photo11: AP)
Skywatchers will get a rare treat Tuesday night when Mars, Earth and the sun will be arranged in a nearly straight line.
Every two years, Mars reaches a point in its orbit called "opposition," when the planet lies directly opposite the sun in Earth's sky, according to Astronomy magazine.
YOUR TAKE: Sky watchers, share your photos of starry skies
This means Mars rises near sunset and remains visible all night long as it moves nearly overhead across the night sky. It will be a bright burnt orange color, NASA's Mars Exploration Program reports, and almost 10 times brighter than the brightest stars in the sky.
"From our perspective on our spinning world, Mars rises in the east just as the sun sets in the west," NASA reports. "Then, after staying up in the sky the entire night, Mars sets in the west just as the sun rises in the east."
With no big storms forecast Tuesday night, according to the National Weather Service, Mars should be visible in most areas.
At their closest point next week, Mars and Earth will "only" be about 57 million miles apart. Another treat awaits April 14, when the full moon also will appear near Mars.
Mars won't appear this big and bright again until its next "opposition" on May 22, 2016, Astronomyreports.

Toy line [ edit ]
The Lady Lovely Locks toyline was created by Mattel and produced from 1987 to 1989. The toyline consists of character dolls that are approximately 8.5 inches tall, with certain dolls having long, colorful locks. Most dolls came with three to four Pixietails (small plastic squirrel-like animals with long silky tails). The Pixietails could be worn in the hair of either Lady Lovely Locks or the child. Additional items in the toyline were other pets and setting playsets.
Animated series [ edit ]
The premise of the series is that Lady Lovely Locks is the princess of the Kingdom of Lovelylocks. She and her friends are aided by the Pixietails in keeping the kingdom safe from its enemies. Among the hero characters of the show are Lady Lovely Locks, Maiden Fair Hair, Maiden Curly Crown, the Pixietails, Prince Strong Heart, Shining Glory, Silky Pup (a puppy), and Silky Mane (a pony). The main villains are Duchess Ravenwaves, Hairball and Comb Gnomes, the latter of whom tend to speak in rhyme. The series was produced by the French and Japanese animators of Rainbow Brite and Jem, among other cartoons of the '80s.
Hi-Tops released five Lady Lovely Locks videos in the '80s. More recently, the videos re-appeared on the market. They resurfaced as part of the DVD set "Girls Rule Vol. 1" which included the following cartoon series: Jem, Rainbow Brite and Lady Lovely Locks.

The Pixietails - tiny, magical creatures with bodies resembling small animals and long, flowy tails with the power of flight. They are the delightful helpers and partners of Lady and her friends who often speak with an "-ix" suffix. They also possess the power of creating magical shields. Each type has an association with the corresponding person; for instance, Lady's were bunny-like (and the most prominent in the series), FairHair's were chipmunk/squirrel-like (and the most patient), and CurlyCrown's were bird-like (and the fastest).

It is also said that he has adopted the Prince after he was cursed. Prince StrongHeart - originally a human, but was turned into a dog as a result of a dreadful curse. He often visits the castle gardens after since he was adopted by Shining Glory. In times, the opportunity for him to turn into human again comes; however, he rather puts this aside into helping his companions, such as coming to Lady's rescue when she is in danger. He was not much likely seen in his previous appearance.
Antagonists [ edit ]
Duchess RavenWaves - the main antagonist. She wears a purple dress and, like Maiden FairHair, her black hair done in waves. She is the mean, jealous, cruel, stubborn, selfish, domineering, cold, careless and conniving ruler of Tangleland, as well as the main archenemy of Lady LovelyLocks. Duchess always plots evil schemes to take over the kingdom of LovelyLocks for herself, and believes that cutting off a piece of her rival's hair would do it.

HairBall - a former apprentice of Shining Glory who is now in employ of RavenWaves. Deemed untrustworthy by good people, he specializes in magic and is very practical when it comes to making and causing trouble. He also acts miserable when he feels defeated; however, this makes him quite sympathetic to his peers.

Comb Gnomes - creatures with big ears and wild-looking hair and fur and henchmen of Duchess RavenWaves and accomplices to HairBall. They are very mischievous and mean-spirited, yet lazy and irresponsible during a plan and become upset when their part of a planned scheme fails. They are also archenemies to the Pixietails, as they all have magical powers, of which theirs is a lightning attack.
Books [ edit ]
A number of tie-in books were released alongside the toyline and animated series. Among these books are "An Enchanting Fairy-Tale Adventure", "For the Love of Lovely Locks", "Lady Lovely Locks Original Story" (1987), "Silkypup Saves the Day", "Silkypup's Butterfly Adventure" (1987) and "The Golden Ball".
Pop culture [ edit ]
In the eighth season episode of the series That '70s Show, "Killer Queen", the character Randy says: "Donna, Hyde's already given me a nickname. It's Mrs. Lady Lovely Locks." This is an anachronism, as the Lady Lovely Locks line of products were not produced until after the mid-1980s.
German audio tapes [ edit ]
In Germany, ten audio tapes were produced by label Europa, which extended on and continued the story lines that were never resolved by the short running TV-show. Not only did the tapes dive into Lady's childhood, they also resolved Prince StrongHeart's curse by turning him human, featured the couple's wedding, the birth of their daughter, as well as the infant's kidnapping by Duchess RavenWaves and her glorious rescue. While each character had her or his own voice actor, the series was narrated by Hans Paetsch. The voice actors differed from those used in the animated series.
Releases [ edit ]
In Germany the first 3 episodes (6 counting the way Germans numbered them) were released on 3 VHS tapes, containing just the plain episodes dubbed in German with the intro and outro scenes as well as a TV commercial for the Lady Lovely Locks toy series.
I was in Israel with film director, Kevin Sim, who was making a documentary on the war game for ˜Dispatches' on Channel 4.
The notional starting point of the game was 9 November 2012, just after the American presidential elections. Participants were divided into ten groups each representing likely key players in the conflict “ Israel, Iran, the US, Russia, Hezbollah, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Russia and the UN. All the teams were made up of Israelis.
The war game is what it says it is “ a game. Despite its seriousness, inside the Institute there was an air of make-believe.
The œNetanyahu who led the Israeli team was an imposter “ a former Deputy Foreign Minister of Israel. Two former government ministers took turns to play Obama. Putin was a former Israeli ambassador to Moscow.
The war game was designed to explore the likely outcome of an Israeli pre-emptive attack on Iran; it didn't examine the legal or moral arguments for or against any such strike but rather focused on how the Iranians might retaliate and what the wider fallout would be.
The game began when the players were told that just after midnight, in a surprise air raid, Israeli bombers had attacked nuclear installations deep inside Iran. First reports indicated that Israel had acted alone without consent or help from the Americans.
The Iranians responded quickly to the Israeli strike, launching a barrage of Shahab-3 ballistic missiles (based on the North Korean Nodong-1 missile) at Israeli targets, including the country's largest city, Tel Aviv. Then they discussed their political goals.
The most immediate of these was the desire to rebuild the nuclear programme, preferably to a level œbeyond what it was on the eve of the strike. Given their newfound status as victims of an attack, another priority was to have the sanctions on Iran lifted; and to have sanctions placed on Israel for its œunprovoked act.
They also decided to offer Jordan and Egypt extensive aid packages to cancel their peace treaties with Israel, before debating a key dilemma: whether or not to attack US targets. With Iran's considerable influence in Iraq and Afghanistan, not to mention its huge presence in the Gulf, the Iranians could cause huge problems for Washington.
In the end, though, the decision was taken to refrain; Washington was one more complication they didn't need. Russia (which has been building the Bushehr nuclear power plant) was also approached for immediate help to rebuild the devastated facilities, as well as delivery of S-300 surface-to-air missiles and a consignment of Sukhoi 24 aircraft.
Militarily, Iran tried to get its allies “ namely, its proxy militia groups Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza “ to enter the conflict on its behalf.
"All our help to you over the years," the Israeli playing Ahmadinejad (a former colonel in military intelligence) declared in a meeting with Hezbollah, "has been for the purpose of this moment."
"There's no such thing as a free lunch," his assistant added. The Lebanese declared they were only too happy to help - in any way that would not bring massive Israeli retaliation down on Lebanon. There was tension in the room.
The Israelis, meanwhile, had met with the œUS President (the Israelis deliberately made no comment on who had won the 7 November US Presidential election), who, despite being unhappy at the lack of a œtimely announcement about the œpremature strike, reiterated his support for Israel. Washington's primary concern, it seemed, was to avoid an escalation of hostilities in what it considered to be the world's most volatile region. It raised the status of alert for its forces across the Middle East.
The Israelis were clear on what they wanted from their US ally. Most important was for Washington to use its ˜good offices' in Lebanon and Gaza to prevent Hezbollah and Hamas inflaming the situation. The Israelis also wanted US ships in the area, armed with Aegis anti-missile systems, to help intercept the Iranian missiles raining down on them.
Finally, they requested that the US maintain pressure on Iran in the UN Security Council, and to help ensure that Israel was not the victim of ˜one sided resolutions in the United Nations."
Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad looks on as Iranian military hardware is displayed march during the National Army Day parade in Tehran, Iran
On the ground, things were tense. As Iran continued s *** ing Israel, people began to leave Tel Aviv heading to the South. Fearing Israeli retaliation, Hezbollah limited themselves to firing only a few, sporadic Katyusha rockets into northern Israel in an attempt to placate their Iranian patron, and succeeded in pushing the inhabitants of the city of Kiryat Shmona into heading south as well. Israel, in turn, instructed its army not to respond to the firing from Lebanon without the Minister of Defense's authorization; army reserves were called up.
But the Israelis were also planning “ for a second wave of strikes against Iran's uranium enrichment facilities, which they undertook about 24 hours (in game time) after the first. This second strike seemed to encapsulate the war game for Israel. Its boldness rewarded and Iran simply unable to respond in kind: limited to firing missiles at Israel, many of which were intercepted - largely by itself.
By the game's end, Iran's nuclear facilities had been almost totally destroyed. Hezbollah and Hamas had done nothing more than launch a few token rocket salvos at Israel, while Iranian missiles had been of only limited effect. Iran had also failed in its attempts to have the sanctions on it removed and, thanks to US cover in the UN Security Council, it had also failed to have sanctions placed on Israel. It was the game's clear loser.
Yehuda Ben-Meir, the former deputy foreign minister of Israel, who had played Netanyahu, summed the situation up. œThe principal insight we gained was that following an Israeli attack the entire world was interested in calming the region down.
"Before the attack everyone had something to say on a possible attack but once it became a fait accompli the world wanted to know what would happen next, and everyone's goal was to contain the situation and to prevent escalation.

I had seen Israel's perspective on a possible attack and now wanted an Iranian view, so I caught a flight to Istanbul to put the game's results to Hossein Mousavian, a former member of Iran's nuclear negotiating team. He believed the game was deeply flawed.
Dismissing the limited nature of Iran's response, Mousavian argued that in reality Iran would respond ˜by all means', employing the total power of its armed forces to draw Israel into a long-term war. Perhaps, more importantly, Mousavian argued that Iran would see the US as complicit.
Iranians, he said, are convinced that Israel is too small to attack Iran unilaterally Iran. "They see Israeli as just a baby, he said. œOne that would never act without US assistance.
The attack would also have huge regional consequences, he continued. Most obviously, Iran would use its status as the symbol of resistance against Israel in the Middle East to stoke the high levels of anti-Americanism that already exist there. Even groups like Al Qaeda, he argued, who are Iran's enemies, would use œinflamed Muslim sentiment to launch attacks at American citizens across the world and on US soldiers on the many American bases in the region.
At the end of our interview, he leaned forward, took my arm and looked me right in the eyes. He recalled the Israeli strikes on an Iraqi nuclear reactor in 1981 and a Syrian reactor in 2007.
œThis is the big mistake that people make, he told me. œTo think if Israel attacks Iran, like it attacked Iraq and Syria, the Iranians would not retaliate.
"The nation is one hundred percent different. The whole region would be engulfed.

Now, Pincus is handing the CEO role over to Zynga board member Frank Gibeau, a 25-year gaming industry veteran credited with completely turning around mega-publisher Electronic Arts' mobile gaming business, the company announced after market close on Tuesday.
Under Gibeau, EA turned mobile games like "The Simpsons: Tapped Out" and "Plants vs. Zombies" into lucrative businesses. Now, the hope is that he'll bring some of that magic to Zynga   because, frankly, the once-hot Zynga needs it.
This was actually Pincus' second run as Zynga CEO: He served as CEO from the company's founding in 2007 through 2013, when he stepped down and handed the role over to Microsoft veteran Don Mattrick. In early 2015, Mattrick himself stepped down, and Pincus stepped back up as CEO.
Despite Zynga's grand ambitions with a slate of new games under Pincus, the "Words With Friends" developer has seen its stock get crushed after whiffing on its most recent earnings.
Still, Pincus tells Business Insider that he's proud of his 11-month tenure as CEO: He says that under his watch, Zynga's teams are collaborating in ways that they hadn't, and the overall culture is far more focused on its most lucrative businesses, including its fast-growing slot machine and poker games.
"I put all of that in motion," Pincus says. "I don't need to win CEO of the year to feel good about that."
words with friends More
Furthermore, Pincus says that plenty of the games he's spearheaded as CEO won't come out until later this year or beyond, meaning that it's too soon to judge his legacy as a business executive.
Still, Gibeau has a challenge ahead. After going no higher than $3.50 over the last year, Zynga stock cratered to $2.16 ahead of this announcement. Meanwhile, reports swirl that Zynga is planning to sell its iconic San Francisco headquarters, which it purchased in 2012 for $228 million.
Pincus says that Gibeau has been very involved with Zynga's business and plans over the seven months he's held a board seat. Because of that, Pincus doesn't anticipate a lot of bumps during the transition.
"I saw more and more opportunity for [Gibeau] to engage here," Pincus says, culminating in Pincus going to the board and asking for this change, he says.
And while Gibeau handles the day-to-day tasks of the chief executive, Pincus says that he's going to stay involved with Zynga, focusing on bigger-picture vision stuff, what he calls "product entrepreneurship," and helping teams within the company talk to each other.
"I think it's important that founders and CEOs are self aware of where they can add value or not," Pincus says.

The A9 chips that power both the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus are sourced from Samsung and TSMC, and reflect different techniques used by each manufacturer. Samsung's process uses 14 nm technology and its A9 has a die size of 96 mm2, while TSMC's 16 nm process has a slightly larger A9 at 104.5 mm2.
Third party tests by AnTuTu, GeekBench, and MyDrivers showed that under high loads that demanded ultimate performance, the TSMC-powered iPhone was offering up to two hours more battery life than the similarly set up Samsung-powered iPhones.
Speaking to TechCrunch, Apple has pointed out that real-world usage is far more reflective of how an iPhone is used that the benchmarking tests, and that in normal use the variance between the two handsets is on the order or two or three percent. Given tolerances in manufacturing, this performance is within the margin of error that many would expect in consumer electronics.
Given an iPhone 6S lasting around ten hours of mixed usage, Apple's quoted variance on battery life between TSMC and Samsung chips would amount to twelve to fifteen minutes.
What will need more testing is to see if the Samsung A9 chips are coming in with consistently lower battery endurances than the TSMC A9 chips, or if the lower demands on the circuitry brings both A9 variants into the same performance envelope.
What's also clear is that Apple will be in a very strong bargaining position for production of the A10 chip, presumably earmarked for next year's iPhone 7. Both manufacturers will be looking for some (or all) of that business, and each will be bidding knowing that its rival has met the previous brief from Apple. That could see Apple able to leverage lower pricing or higher volumes, extracting yet more value from the supply chain in a premium smartphone product.
At the top of those findings for 2017 is the Tesla Model X as The Most Loved Vehicle in America. The Model X creates considerable Love across many aspects of the vehicle experience, from power and performance to human-machine-interface (HMI) and driver assistance features, on top of perceived environmental friendliness. The individuality and prestige of the Model X compliment the sense of power that comes from driving one to create an exciting luxury vehicle that owners are proud to call their own.
BMW is the Most Loved luxury brand in 2017, delivering on both performance and workmanship expected of the make and creating strong advocacy and loyalty intention for the brand. Coming in close behind BMW and ahead of Lexus is the emerging luxury brand Genesis. The Genesis G90 is the Most Loved Luxury Car of the year, and the new brand presents a significant challenge to established luxury players. The current Genesis vehicles deliver a product and emotional experience comparable to BMW, at a much stronger perceived value with warranty coverage and level of standard equipment their owners love. œLuxury is defined by more than just the vehicle itself, making a comparable sales and service experience critical for Genesis to complement its strong products and increase overall advocacy and loyalty.
However, true Love isn't reserved only for the luxury brands. On the truck side, the Japanese manufacturers have delivered Standard and Full-Size Pickups that their owners truly love, with Honda Ridgeline and Toyota Tundra being the Most Loved Vehicles in their respective segments. Any lingering doubts about the ability of Japanese manufacturers' to produce Loveworthy pickups should be dismissed by the owner response to these trucks. Ridgeline offers comfort through overall quietness inside a truck that is easy to access and use. Tundra builds Love with a truck sized and styled to convey durability and a roomy, easily accessed second row of seating.
Volkswagen may be showing the early signs of a recovery in consideration after its earlier diesel emissions troubles. VW Loyalty Intention has moved closer to the Industry average (39% vs 41%) compared to being under-water last year. VW products continue to create strong positive emotional experiences for owners. Time and efforts to improve brand trustworthiness may make it easier for those owners to remain with the vehicles they Love.

Egyptian TV quoted medical authorities as saying at least 73 people had been killed. Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the nation's military ruler, dispatched military planes to Port Said to pick up Ahly players and fans and return them to Cairo.
Violence broke out in the coastal town of Port Said after that city's team won a rare victory over the visiting Ahly, a powerhouse club from Cairo. Port Said supporters rushed the field immediately after the game as chaos spread and players and fans from Ahly ran for cover beneath the stadium and into locker rooms.
REPORTING FROM CAIRO -- The death toll rose to at least 73 people late Wednesday after hooligans from the winning team stormed onto the field after an Egyptian soccer match between two longtime rivals and attacked opposing players and fans.
The soccer riot was yet was another sign of how fragile and combustible Egypt is as it unsteadily attempts to move toward democracy in the year since the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak. There have been sharp animosities between the two teams -- Port Said fans attacked an Ahly bus last year -- but nothing indicating the level of hostilities that ignited Wednesday night.
œThere are 11 deaths at my hospital. Two other hospitals include 25 deaths. Three fans have also died in the stadium," Hassan Esnawy, the manager of Port Said's El Amiry hospital, said in a television interview. œSome died of stampede and others died of suffocation.
Indications of the mayhem to come occurred when Port Said fans threw fireworks at Ahly players before the match. Hooligans tried unsuccessfully to rush the field during halftime but there were no confrontations during 90-minutes of play.
Moments after the game, which Port Said won 3 to 1, hooligans sprinted across the field, attacking Ahly players and fans.
Two Ahly players were injured and the team quickly blamed police for not preventing the onslaught.
œThe security forces left us, they did not protect us. One fan has just died in the dressing room in front of me, veteran Ahly player Mohamed Abou-Treika yelled in a phone while speaking to a TV channel.
Another Ahly player, Mohamed Baraket, said: œPeople have died, we are seeing corpses now. There are no security forces or army personnel to protect us.
Ahly's TV channel reported that Port Said fans blocked ambulances from reaching the field for up to 90 minutes. Those reports could not be independently confirmed.

A new poll just released minutes ago reveals that a large number of Greek voters have turned to the radical left-wing Syriza Party in the wake of recent elections. The election has failed to produce a coalition so far, and it is likely new elections will be called as soon as this weekend.
In the poll held Tuesday support for Syriza has grown from 16.8% in the last election to 23.8%, surpassing the conservative and current largest party in parliament, New Democracy.
In the  *** enic Parliament, the party that receives the most votes gets an extra 50 seats in theory to help it form a coalition. If Syriza emerges with the coming elections with this large bonus it will possibly hold the future of Greece, and much of the European economy, in its hands.
Syriza is staunchly opposed to austerity, and would lead a revolt against the EU imposed measures if it gains power.
The full poll results
Syriza: 23.8%, up from 16.8% in the election
New Democracy: 17.4%, down from 18.9%
PASOK: 10.8%, down from 13.2%
Independent Greeks: 8.7%, down from 10.6%
KKE: 6.0%, down from 8.48%
Golden Dawn: 4.9%, down from 7%
Dimar: 4.0%, down from 6.11%
According to researcher Patrick Dunstan, Directory Services' command line utility can be run by any user. By itself, this isn't necessarily a security problem, but at least two functions make it trivial to access user password hashes or even change the current user's password without administrator authentication.
Using Directory Services to read a user's profile doesn't normally show password information; it is usually stored in a shadow file that only the root user can access. However, using a "Search" directory path will show a range of extended attributes for the user, including the user's hashed password.
Running the command
$ dscl localhost -read /Search/Users/currentuser
will include the following output
dsAttrTypeNative:ShadowHashData: 62706c69 73743030 d101025d 53414c54 45442d53 48413531 324f1044 74911f72 3bd2f66a 3255e0af 4b85c639 776d510b 63f0b939 c432ab6e 082286c4 7586f19b 4e2f3aab 74229ae1 24ccb11e 916a7a1c 9b29c64b d6b0fd6c bd22e7b1 f0ba1673 080b1900 00000000 00010100 00000000 00000300 00000000 00000000 00000000 000060
As Dunstan notes, hackers can use the hashed data to attempt to crack the actual password.
Perhaps an even easier attack vector, though, is using Directory Services to simply change the current user's password. Attempting to change the current user's password via Directory Services will simply result in a prompt for a new password without a request for administrator authentication. If a remote user can gain s ***  access, they could use this method to simply change the password of the current user. If that user is an admin, the hacker could use sudo to run as root. If not, the hacker may still be able to access hashes of other users and attempt to crack them.
Dunstan recommends limiting access to Directory Services command line utility until Apple can issue a patch for these issues. If you are comfortable in Terminal, running the following command as an admin will limit other users from being able to run Directory Services
Just days after Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy ordered police not to cooperate with ICE in enforcing immigration laws, a previously deported illegal alien went on a murderous rampage killing a mother and stabbing her friend.
From The Hartford Courant
A convicted felon, who was previously deported, fatally stabbed a woman and abducted their 6-year-old daughter from a Bridgeport home, triggering an Amber Alert and multi-state search that ended after a highway police chase and crash in Pennsylvania, authorities said.
Though the child, Aylin Hernandez, did not suffer serious physical injuries, police said her 26-year-old mother, Nidia Gonzalez, was dead. Another woman, believed to be a friend, was stabbed repeatedly in the home on Greenwood Street in Bridgeport, police said.
The injured woman, who police declined to identify, was in critical but stable condition at St. Vincent's Medical Center in Bridgeport late Friday. Oscar Obedio Hernandez, 39, the suspect at the center of the sprawling search, was in custody in Pennsylvania late Friday. Bridgeport police Capt. Brian Fitzgerald said authorities planned to bring the girl back to family in Connecticut with the assistance of the state's Department of Children and Families.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials confirmed late Friday that Hernandez, a citizen of El Salvador, was issued a final order of removal by an immigration judge on Oct. 29, 2013.
"He was removed from the United States by ICE officers in Hartford on Nov. 27, 2013," Shawn Neudauer, an ICE spokesman, said in a statement. "He has prior felony convictions from 2002 for assault and threatening, as well as several misdemeanor convictions. ICE has placed an immigration detainer with the Bridgeport Police Department." It's not just Hernandez who has blood on his hands as you can see in the picture below.
The Governor ordered law enforcement to stand down from enforcing our nation's immigration laws.
Hernandez's arrest came days after Gov. Dannel P. Malloy sent a memo to police chiefs recommending they not cooperate with ICE to enforce immigration laws and that "law enforcement should not take action that is solely to enforce federal immigration law." His stance made national news, and was criticized by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. But in the case of Hernandez, who had a prior felony conviction, state or local police would have held him for federal agents, in accordance with state law, a spokeswoman for Malloy said.
"Our local laws are designed to protect our residents and also ensure that those in harm's way feel safe seeking help from law enforcement," said Kelly Donnelly. "That's why convicted violent felons are detained for deportation under our state laws that the governor has consistently and strongly supported." What a load of crap. If our immigration laws were enforced murderers like Hernandez wouldn't even be in our country.
Hernandez, as they note, is from El Salvador. El Salvador has one of the highest murder rates in the world. The country is filled with terrorist drug gangs like MS13.
Around one fifth of the entire country is now living in the United States.
Incidentally, the more El Salvadorians come to the US, the more dead bodies happen to show up outside playgrounds and schools with MS13's fingerprints on them.
Go figure.
If Mr. Malloy and leftists like him actually gave a  ***  about keeping Americans safe, they'd be doing everything they could to help build the wall and expand our nation's deportation force.

Alcohol plays a well-documented role in literary life “ or at least it used to, what with liquid lunches and all-night benders that ended at the typewriter. (The clatter of those keys must have been murder with a hangover, which perhaps explains why certain authors chose to remain drunk instead.)
These days, wordsmiths tend to be a more sober bunch but their reputation for enjoying a nip of this, a flagon of that, and a vat of the other, endures. It's hardly surprising that some of the stronger stuff has sloshed onto their pages and into their stories. Flip through classics old and new and you'll find scenes of weepy, wanton, comical, carefree and tragic inebriation, in which beds get set alight (as in Kingsley Amis' Lucky Jim), bears are tied to policemen and thrown into rivers (Tolstoy's War and Peace), and wives sold (Thomas Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge). Children's literature isn't exempt either “ remember when Roald Dahl's Fantastic Mr Fox led a raid on Farmer Bean's cider cellar?
Proof reading
Some authors run up a longer bar tab than others. As one Thomas Pynchon devotee has discovered, there's enough liquor in the Pulitzer Prize winner's books to generate a dedicated blog. In May, the anonymous fan, who also tweets as @Drunk Pynchon, embarked on a project to imbibe every drink mentioned in every Pynchon novel. Let's hope he has a strong constitution because Gravity's Rainbow alone features almost 50 different libations, including something that calls for grain alcohol, beef tea, grenadine, herbal infusions (blue skullcap, valerian root, motherwort and lady's slipper, no less) and a dash of cough syrup.
It's the kind of drink you could imagine Raoul Duke and Dr Gonzo consuming on their road trip through southern California in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. In fact, it's pretty much the only thing they don't drink. Alcohol fumes rise from the page as they wash down a rainbow of pills with everything from beer to tequila. Their baggage includes a pint of raw ether.
And then there's the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster', as invented by Zaphod Beeblebrox in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Imbibing this  *** tail, Douglas Adams wrote, is œlike having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon, wrapped œround a large gold brick, which is no wonder with ingredients like Arcturan Mega-gin, Fallian marsh gas and the tooth of an Angolian Suntiger. Its effects, you might imagine, are every bit as disorienting as the potion that Lewis Carroll's Alice glugs.
A more refined literary  *** tail list might feature a sidecar, as sipped by wealthy Arthur Ruskin in Bonfire of the Vanities, a white angel, which was Holly Golightly's choice, or a refreshing daiquiri, James Wormold's order in Graham Greene's Our Man in Havana. Jay Gatsby prefers gin rickeys while Daisy Buchanan is a mint julep kind of a gal. For Anthony Blanche in Brideshead Revisited, it's brandy alexanders, that sticky mix of cream, cognac and crÃ¨me de cacao. Personally, I prefer the sound of the jack roses that boozy Jake Barnes knocks back in Ernest Hemingway's career-maker, The Sun Also Rises. They're a mix of applejack, lemon or lime juice, and a splash of grenadine.
There are simpler drinks, too. In On the Road, Dean and Sal hang out in a San Francisco ˜sawdust saloon' where a guy named Walter orders wine spodiodi, ˜a shot of port wine, a shot of whisky, and a shot of port wine'.
Then there's the Moloko Plus. Also called a Knifey Moloko, this fictitious tipple comes in many forms but is essentially milk with barbiturates. Featured in Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange, it's drunk by the narrator Alex in preparation for œa bit of the old ultraviolence.
Raymond Chandler's chess-playing sleuth, Philip Marlowe, keeps things altogether mellower with a gimlet, a recipe for which appears in The Long Goodbye. The drink becomes the glue in a fledgling friendship between the loner private eye and a washed-up playboy named Terry Lennox. œA real gimlet is half gin and half Rose's Lime Juice and nothing else, Lennox tells Marlowe. œIt beats martinis hollow.
And since he brings them up, it would be remiss not to at least nod to the œvery strong vesper martini that Ian Fleming describes so precisely in Casino Royale. It comprises three measures of gin, one of vodka and a half-measure of the French aperitif Lillet. Shake until ice-cold, then pour into a deep champagne goblet and finish with a twist.
˜In vino veritas'
Of course, authors were dousing their pages with liquor long before the invention of the  *** tail. Weave your way back towards the canon's beginning, and you'll find the hero of Beowulf defending the king's vast mead hall against the marauding monster Grendel, who's seemingly incensed by the drinkers' din. Mead, if you've never encountered it, is a honey-based wine with an ale-like taste, beloved by humans if not Old English ogres.
It pops up in Shakespeare's plays, too, along with still more obscure wines like malmsey and canary (it really did have a yellow tint, apparently). For that joker Falstaff, though, there was only one tipple: sherry. As he eulogises in Henry IV, Part II, it makes him witty and bold, warms his blood and sets his face aglow. Drunk, in other words.
For authors, on the page though infinitely less so their lives, drunkenness is put to good use, becoming another tool for illuminating their characters' traits and fates: in vino veritas, as the saying goes. And while it wreaks its fair share of Bacchic destruction (just consider the middle portion of Donna Tartt's The Goldfinch), in moderation, it can also be a force for good, as when Ebenezer Scrooge offers to share a bowl of Smoking Bishop (that's port, wine, oranges and spices) with Bob at the end of A Christmas Carol.
If just reading about all this boozy over-indulgence has left you a little tipsy, there's one drink from Gravity's Rainbow that might be best: a Shirley Temple.
Cheers!
Holliday walked leading of the 11th Saturday and Jacoby Ellsbury followed with a grounder to first baseman Mitch Moreland, who threw to second for a forceout. Holliday retreated toward first and slid into the bag as shortstop Xander Bogaerts' throw arrived.
Moreland wasn't able to reach the ball, which hit Ellsbury and bounced into foul territory. Farrell argued for an interference call, but umpires allowed Ellsbury to stay on first.
''We still firmly believe there was interference on the play and if it goes unaddressed or without any further attention brought to it, who's to say you can't instruct runners to do the same going forward?'' Farrell said Sunday.
Holliday said he was unaware Moreland did not touch first before throwing to second.

That truth is particularly relevant in light of the recent failure of all 45 hand-picked, highly fit women to complete Ranger training and Marine-officer combat training. The 45 women were part of an effort to meet a 2016 deadline mandating that all combat roles, including special forces, be opened up to women   an ideologically driven, reality-challenged initiative.

Putting women into close combat roles isn't fair to the men who will be relying on them, and isn't fair to the women who will find themselves continuously at a deadly disadvantage. When we send our soldiers into combat we should be giving them the best possible chance of succeeding and surviving. While women are equal to or better than men at many tasks, they simply aren't when it comes to combat. Substituting men with far less combat-capable women is profoundly unfair, immoral, and utterly unnecessary.
A recent study, for instance, by Britain's Tri-Service Review found that mixed-gender combat units have œlower survivability, a œreduced lethality rate and reduced deployability. This study, along with countless others done over the last 40 years, demonstrate that combat capabilities are so heavily weighted toward men that the gap cannot be closed. As Marine Corps captain Lauren Serrano put it in a September 2014 article in the Marine Gazette: œAcknowledging that women are different (not just physically) than men is a hard truth that plays an enormous role in this discussion.
Consider the three major arguments for putting women into combat   none of them hold up.
Before looking at the facts surrounding the hard truth referred to by Captain Serrano, consider the three major arguments for putting women into combat.
Advertisement
The first and most commonly used argument goes something like this: œNot sure if it's a good idea, but if women can meet the same standards as men, then I guess it would only be fair to allow them into combat.
But the last 40 years of aggressive integration efforts by the U.S. military have shown that women cannot meet the same rigorous standards as men   and the answer has been to implement different standards for women, while lowering the standards for men, too. A 2011 study on physical requirements necessary for specific occupations in the military conducted by Dr. William Gregor for the U.S. Army's School of Advanced Military Studies concludes
The Services, especially the Army, have expanded the military occupational specialties (MOS) open to women purely as a part of the social concern for equality and have only paid lip service to combat readiness. . . . The Army's own research indicates that the vast majority of women do not possess the lean mass necessary to meet the strength requirements for very heavy and heavy physical MOS's.

The Army assigns women to these specialties anyway.
What loads do women have trouble bearing? œWomen soldiers are challenged by some field combat duties   carrying five-gallon cans of fuel and water, changing armor vehicle track and heavy truck tires, carrying 100-plus-pound loads of ammunition and fighting gear on extended dismounted operations, carrying stretchers of wounded soldiers, and the brute labor required to dig in fighting positions, retired general Barry McCaffrey explains. (Another detailed, generously footnoted 2007 study published in the Duke Law Journal, œConstructing the COED Military, by Elaine Donnelly, gives an overview of our military's misguided gender-integration efforts and details how double standards, quotas, and preferential treatment are damaging our military.)
For proof that integrating women into combat will mean lower standards for men and women, just ask the current chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey, who said in 2013, œIf we do decide that a particular standard is so high that a woman couldn't make it, the burden is now on the service to come back and explain to the secretary: Why is it that high? Does it really have to be that high? Given the current political environment and the lack of moral courage from our political and military leaders, there's no doubt these standards will be reevaluated and less-rigorous ones adopted.
This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the military's physical and psychological toughness standards for men have also declined. The military as whole   even in basic training   has become kinder and gentler, partly in order to accommodate women. In one of the more ridiculous examples of this, Army drill instructors were required to wear œempathy bellies and fake  *** *s to better empathize with pregnant women. Today's drill instructors are nicer than they used to be, but the speed at which we are discarding time-proven methods for training soldiers is breathtaking and reckless.
A willingness to die for one's country is a noble and a necessary condition for effective combat soldiers, but it is far from sufficient.
Another common argument is that women are already dying in combat zones, so it's only fair to formalize what they are doing. But this debate is not about the supreme sacrifice that 144 servicewomen have made in combat zones since 9/11, but how effective women can be in doing a different job   projecting combat power, killing the enemy, and surviving to fight another day. The women who have died in service to their country need to be honored, but they should not be honored by increasing the chances that other servicemen and women will die as well. As former Marine Jude Eden writes in the April 2015 edition of Military Review, œBeing in the combat zone, dangerous as it is, is still worlds away from the door-kicking offensive missions of our combat units. Being killed in a crash or by an IED is not the same as surviving physically demanding combat patrols carrying combat loads of 60 to 140 pounds, which challenge even men's superior endurance and strength. A willingness to die for one's country is a noble and a necessary condition for effective combat soldiers, but it is far from sufficient.
The third argument: In other cultures and times, women have performed as well in combat as men. In particular, modern-day Israel is often cited as an example of women successfully fulfilling combat roles. But Israel's military position is almost nothing like that of the United States: It's surrounded by hostile nations that collectively outnumber its population by over 20 to 1. Even so, for many of the reasons discussed, women no longer participate in front-line IDF combat units. While it is true that countries such as Israel and Russia in the past, and the Kurdish military today, have been forced by dire circumstances to rely on women to literally defend their own persons, their children, and their house against savage invaders, thankfully we are in no such position.

So why do men and women perform so differently in combat-related tasks? First, physiologically and psychologically, women and men are significantly different. Men are not simply bigger women with different plumbing. Men's blood carries 10 to 12 percent more oxygen per liter than does a women's; and men's VO2 max, a measure of the top rate of oxygen consumption, is 40 to 60 percent greater than that of women. An average fit man will weigh about 23 percent more, have 50 percent more muscle mass, and carry 10 percent less body fat than an average fit woman. Pound for pound, men have thicker skulls, bigger, stronger necks, hearts that are 17 percent larger, and bones that are both bigger and denser. Despite being much heavier, men's vertical leap is nearly 50 percent greater than that of women.
In terms of reflexes and reaction times, men significantly outperform women. When confronted with immediate danger, studies suggest men are œmore likely than women to take action. Women are far more likely to experience motion sickness and vertigo. In the Navy women go on sick call 60 to 70 percent more frequently. For the kind of violent events and situations found on the battlefield, women are far more likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder and experience the symptoms for a longer duration than men. Despite the gender-specific ability to handle the pain of childbirth, œstudy after study conclusively shows that men have a much higher overall tolerance for pain than women.
Individually, any one of above differences could make the difference between life and death. In the combat environment, the differences between men and women in speed, strength, endurance, agility, physical resiliency, and psychological resiliency represents an unbridgeable gap   and the impact on the battlefield is dramatic.
Mixed-gender units will be both slower in getting to the fight and slower when beating a tactical retreat.
Mixed-gender units will be both slower in getting to the fight and slower when beating a tactical retreat. They are more likely to be crippled by physical injuries or PTSD. Men will put themselves in harm's way to assist women in getting over obstacles that men can easily negotiate unassisted. Blows to the head or other concussive events that a man can shrug off will stun or render a woman unconscious, reducing her unit's chances of survival, especially in hand-to-hand combat. Units will have to deal with feminine-hygiene issues that significantly reduce unit effectiveness.
This is not merely theory: One Army study focusing on Operation Iraqi Freedom found women are almost twice as likely to suffer from non-combat related disease and injuries and are twice as likely to be medevac'd out of the theater of operations. Historical non-deployment rates for women are three to four times than that of men. Women suffer many times the rate of stress fractures and ACL injuries. All of this hurts combat readiness and increases costs. That we will still be able to defeat vastly inferior opponents is beside the point   more of our soldiers will die and our combat units will be less capable.

The military has been trying to devise programs that will close these gaps for decades, and hasn't succeeded. A Royal Society of Medicine study on the British military found that that injuries skyrocketed for women œwhen they undertake the same arduous training as male recruits. The end result was that women were eight times more likely to be discharged with back pain, tendon injuries, and stress fractures than their male counterparts. Indeed, many studies show that rigorous training only widens the gap between men and women.
This is all before we get to unit cohesion. If you have been around more than a couple of decades, you know that men and women working together in tight quarters will develop infatuations and relationships that will affect unit discipline and morale. Even mature, highly disciplined men and women are susceptible. The U.S. military is already awash in discipline and morale problems coming out of female“male interactions. Captain Serrano notes that œplatoon commanders in co-ed units already deal with a tremendous amount of drama, pregnancies, and *** in the co-ed unit barracks. The unavoidable disruption means units that are less lethal and less survivable.

The push to put women into combat is driven by an extreme, reality-challenged form of feminism. Unfortunately, its influence in the media, the entertainment industry, our universities, and politics has given it a tremendous base of political power that extends into the heart of the military. Jude Eden notes: œIn my experience, feminism and political correctness are so prevalent in the military that men trip over themselves trying to ensure they do not offend. Military leaders cannot afford to even think the truth: Women are not as strong and athletic as strong, athletic men are. Officers in the military understand that speaking honestly about the problems of women in combat can be a career-ender, while putting gender-diversity goals ahead of everything else can be a career-accelerator.
What we have is a modern-day case of the emperor's new clothes. But over the decades, so many compromises to the truth have been made and careers advanced by hiding or glossing over gender-integration issues in the military that it will take more than one small voice standing athwart the road yelling œstop! It will take concerted opposition from a range of politicians who have the courage to look beyond the latest headline in the New York Times or on CNN.

œThat our Congress is accepting this change without any debate isn't progress, Washington Post columnist Kathleen Parker has written. œIt is a dereliction of duty and, one is tempted to say, suggestive of cowardice. The silence on this issue by the Republican-controlled Congress is deafening.
Mountains of evidence exists, providing an excellent basis for congressional hearings about this misguided crusade. Undoubtedly, these hearings will inflame the media and academia, but not holding these hearings, not speaking out on this issue, puts politics before the lives of our young women and men.
  Julie Bindel, U.K. Guardian, May 25
Julie Bindel is a British feminist notorious for saying that all males should be rounded up and put œin some kind of camp. She is a radical lesbian who is against heteroassassass, per se. This anti-male ideology is endorsed by many leading feminists, including Professor Charlotte Bunch, Professor Marilyn Frye, Professor Sheila Jeffreys and others. As Professor Susan M. Shaw and Professor Janet Lee declare in their textbook Women's Voices, Feminist Visions, all women are oppressed by œheteropatriarchy, a system of œinequality and privilege.
Quite obviously, therefore, marriage is incompatible with feminism, and Julie Bindel wants to make sure everybody understands this
Dress it up, subvert it, deny it all you want   marriage is an institution that has curtailed women's freedom for centuries. But instead of rejecting the patriarchal and outdated tradition, some feminists have decided to œreclaim it. We may have progressed since the Industrial Revolution, where Mary Wollstonecraft described marriage as œlittle more than a state of legal prostitution, but let's not kid ourselves. Even today, marriage is not about equality. It's about perpetuating male privilege. Being given away by your father may seem cute and romantic, but it stems from a time when women were seen literally as their father's, and then their husband's, property. The majority of brides still opt for a white gown, but the implication that brides should be virgins is both ludicrous and insulting to women. That a female who has had *** is somehow spoiled goods goes against everything feminists claim to stand for. I know feminists who have taken their husband's name because they say it's easier. Easier than changing your personal email address, utilities bills and bank account details, I suppose. You're basically being branded, so anyone who sees your name knows immediately who you belong to. Even if a woman does away with all these traditions, accept it   marriage can never be a feminist act. It has formed the backdrop to women's oppression for centuries and it continues to do so. Forced marriage, child brides and polygamy all show how human rights of women and girls all too often go hand-in-hand with marriage. It was not until 1991 that rape in marriage was made a criminal offense in England and Wales, and today it is still perfectly legal for a man to rape his wife in 47 countries worldwide. If you want to get marriage, then just get on with it, but please stop pretending that because you're a feminist, it's some kind of subversive statement. I love Snoop Dogg despite his woman-hating lyrics, but I don't pretend that listening to him is a feminist act, and women should stop pretending that marriage is anything other than a tool for their own oppression. Anyway, as the late human rights lawyer Paula Ettelbrick said, œMarriage is a great institution, if you like living in institutions.
You can argue with Julie Bindel about the details of her anti-marriage rant, if you wish, but I never argue with feminists. All I do is quote them, so that everyone understands what I mean when I say Feminism Is a Totalitarian Movement to Destroy Civilization as We Know It.
Of course, it would be impossible for feminists to be oppressed by marriage, if men did not make the mistake of marrying feminists. Honestly, I can't imagine why any man would do such a foolish thing
Never talk to a feminist.
Guys: Learn to take a hint. Learn to walk away.
If a woman tells you she is a feminist, say nothing and walk away.
No feminist wants to hear what a man has to say, and life is too short to waste your time taking to feminists. Just walk away.
Leave feminists alone, and then they can complain about that.
Avoiding feminists, however, does not mean that a man is not oppressing feminists, to whom the very existence of males is oppressive.
Can't wait to tell my wife she's been perpetuating male privilege for 27 years. https://t.co/ai6PCllmJ6 @bindelj pic.twitter.com/3xJ6xpyyLb   FreeStacy (@Not_RSMcCain) May 30, 2016

"This is a historic opportunity to address one of the biggest problems facing our electoral system."
 Wendy Weiser, director of the Brennan Center for Justice's Democracy Program
The plaintiffs in the case a dozen Wisconsin residents argue "Republican legislative leaders authorized a secretive and exclusionary mapmaking process aimed at securing for their party a large advantage that would persist no matter what happened in future elections."
Recent high-profile gerrymandering cases have focused primarily on the racial impact of redistricting. In May, the Supreme Court deemed North Carolina's map unconstitutional on the grounds that district lines were drawn with the intention of "reducing the voting power of minorities," as Mother Jones put it.
Currently, however, there are several cases in Pennsylvania and Maryland, for instance in which partisan redistricting is the center of attention.
SCOTUS has struck down racial gerrymandering but not partisan gerrymandering. That could change next term https://t.co/Tcun1IvJ9o   Ari Berman (@AriBerman) June 19, 2017

Given the impact gerrymandering has had on recent elections, the Wisconsin case is being hailed as potentially "revolutionary," one that could have "massive implications for redistricting and political power in America."
Last November, a panel of federal judges ruled 2-1 that Wisconsin Republicans in 2011 designed the congressional map to "make it more difficult for Democrats, compared to Republicans, to translate their votes into seats." Given the Supreme Court's decision to take on the case, the judges' ruling could reverberate nationally.
"Both parties draw congressional and legislative districts to their own advantage," the Washington Post's Robert Barnes notes. "But Republicans have more to lose because they control so many more state legislatures."
Voter advocacy groups, which have long denounced GOP-drawn congressional districts as discriminatory and blatantly undemocratic, were quick to celebrate the Supreme Court's move.
"For too long, the important task of redistricting has resembled a back-alley brawl: no rules, no referees, and no holds barred," Dan VicuÃ±a, the national redistricting manager for Common Cause, said in a statement. "Technology has made it easier than ever for self-interested legislators to manipulate districts for political advantage, so it is essential that courts step in to protect voters' fundamental constitutional rights."
Karen Hobert Flynn, president of Common Cause, added that gerrymandering "drive[s] too many Americans from our democratic process because citizens feel their votes don't count and sadly in states like Wisconsin and North Carolina today many of those citizens are absolutely right."
"Politicians should not be choosing their voters, voters should be choosing their politicians," she concluded.
Wendy Weiser, director of the Brennan Center for Justice's Democracy Program, also applauded the Supreme Court's announcement on Monday, calling it "a historic opportunity to address one of the biggest problems facing our electoral system."
Mr. Sanders   who, of course, isn't even a registered Democrat   is banging on about what he calls œMedicare for All, a government-run plan that would provide health care coverage for every American.
But now the crusty Vermont independent wants to be a senatorial pied piper for Democrats. He has made his proposal into a kind of litmus test for who is a œgood Democrat, inveigling 16 of his colleagues   more than a third of Senate Democrats   into endorsing it.
A recent spill from his bike put Hanson into the hospital, and his observations from the emergency room of third world immigrants getting first world healthcare are illuminating.
More disturbing is his report of a neighbor being killed a week ago for confronting œintruders on his farm who were stripping a stolen car.
That case was apparently the murder of George Salwasser: Four Suspects Accused of Killing Valley Farmer, May 13, 2014.
Here are Hanson's reflections from the ER
Life is turned upside down in a nanosecond.
This weekend I missed my first posting at PJ Media since beginning in 2006.
Why? Let me briefly explain the lapse   if I can be forgiven for comparing a bike accident with what I have seen on the farm the last 50 years (sliced off fingers, crushed legs, herbicide poisonings, manifold burns, etc.).
I was going on a usual morning bike ride   safe stuff with like-minded older folks. I'm 60; so is my biking partner and fellow Hoover Institution associate Bruce Thornton. We are hardly reckless. (Not like sulfuring at midnight recklessly in one's 20s in the old days without goggles or mask.)
We usually go deliberately during off-traffic hours when cars are rare, on little-traveled roads and bike paths. We always follow the same direction over the same 32-mile route. After nine years we have memorized every bump, cracked bit of pavement, bad stop light, etc. We bike slowly, about 14-15 mph, always in single file. We are, after all, 60 and hear daily horrific stories of injured and dead bikers.
In nearly ten years of rides, I have had some scrapes but only two bad spills (a homeless person once jumped out from the bushes on a Santa Rosa bike path; I swerved to miss him and ended up going over the handlebars: slight concussion; broken shoulder, three ribs, and collar bone. I was also attacked and knocked flat once by a pack of dogs with no licenses, shots, or English-speaking owners). So we must be doing something carefully, for our sixtyish group of three or four to usually avoid problems.
I lead a yearly tour on May 17th, so usually quit riding one week ahead, just in case. Friday morning was to be last ride until I came back on May 30.
About four-fifths of the way home, suddenly the front wheel locked and I woke up about 15 seconds later with my face on the pavement. Four hours later at the emergency room I discovered that I had four ruined teeth (three shaved off, one split down the middle into the root), a concussion, a broken nose, 65 stitches for facial and gum lacerations, and a sliced-apart lower lip (with broken teeth shards sticking into my upper lip).
What happened? Apparently a hairline fissure around the carbon bike fork failed, and the fork bent and locked up the front wheel without warning. (Yes, I know I should inspect the bike thoroughly each time I get on, but the crack was invisible.)
Seven days after falling, I am leaving for Europe and the tour this week, a bit dizzy, fearful that my ogre-like appearance will turn off audiences. I've been getting out of bed to rush off to various doctors to extract a split abscessing tooth, do a bone graft, grind off jagged teeth points that have lacerated my tongue, have stitches removed, etc.   and feel both foolish and very lucky. I had a jammed neck and was a bit disorientated, suggesting to the ER staff a fracture and perhaps serious neck problems. But the CT scan came back normal. After sitting under bags of ice and gobs of Neosporin ointment the last five days, I have reflected on the unforgiving moment that changes everything.
Again, I feel very fortunate. The ER personnel offered tales of lesser bike falls where the victims ended up paralyzed, or with cranial bleeding   or dead.
But when you are lying flat and cannot read or talk or eat, your mind wanders into retrospection and memoriae temporis acti   dreaming of the sort that one must be careful about, lest it devolves into the depression of should have, could have, would have done this or that.
I offer a general thought from the ER and subsequent last five days: we live in a weird postmodern/premodern world. Never have Americans been so blessed and never so ungracious.
The ER trauma center was postmodern: even a plastic surgeon was on duty, who did wonders with my hanging lip and crushed nose. The triage team was top-notch. The equipment, nursing staff, and regimen were stellar. Without them I would be infected, disfigured, and bedridden. (Though I may hold off entirely on that optimism until May 30th, when I am back and the gambit of not canceling has been proven wise. How do you tell your guests that you were stupid enough to endanger their entire trip?)
For five hours, I watched the worst imaginable cases wheeled in   the wages of burns, wrecks, shootings, stabbings, falls, drug overdoses, heart attacks, shock, etc.   all met with an upbeat, can-do staff professionalism.
The clientele, however   metal detector required for entrance   was premodern. Many were foreign nationals. Some appeared to be gang-bangers. Police were ubiquitous (not all the injured were virtuous or harmed by accident). English was rarely spoken by the patients. It was a world away from the ER crowd of rural California circa 1960.
Gurneys were parked in hallways that were almost blocked with sick patients, most of them texting in boredom. Relatives were arguing with other outpatients' relatives. It reminded me of the bottom floor of the Evangelismos Hospital at Athens about 1973, where I once had a sliced finger tendon; on another occasion a shock reaction to a bad Greek plague/ typhus/yellow fever/small pox/typhoid all in one vaccination. Or Luxor circa 1974 (a case of malaria) or Libya 2006 (ruptured appendix). What was different in the American hospital circa 2014 was not the chaos, or the swarms of violently injured, but the superb quality of the care.
In a word, some of the most violent gang-bangers on the planet are accorded some of the most sophisticated trauma care in the world, and for free. I say that not so that it should not be that way, but note it only in hopes that there is some gratitude offered to our health care providers. Do any of our leaders in their various grievances against the society ever express thanks that a man can cross the border, get into a knife fight, even while committing a crime, and in extremis receive free health care of the sort comparable to that accorded to our president?
Only in America? And as it should be.
Spending five hours with those who clean up the mess of one too many beers or a drug OD gave me a strange sense of tragedy. The more spectacular the efforts of 21st century America to ensure equality, the more the effort is expected and critiqued than appreciated as an object of wonder.
Other reflections from five days on my back: Almost half of the patients around me in the ER seemed to be suffering from moribund obesity. Diabetes is a California epidemic. Latest reports suggest that well over 40% of Hispanics, to take one especially at-risk group, admitted to the hospital for all causes are diagnosed with it, higher than the general rate in other populations. Given huge influxes across a porous border, health care in California in the next 10 years will largely center on diabetes. It will have far more social effect than even the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s. It will **** more people, more adversely tax the health care system and require a Marshall Plan-like effort to enlighten the population about diet and exercise.
More likely, however, the system will instead be seen as the culprit and be faulted for not offering enough medical services for diabetes patients that may well total a quarter of California's population in the next decade. We will not hear that the individual has a responsibility not to drink sugar-filled Cokes each day. Too much of the wrong food, not existential hunger, is the epidemic of the poor.
Some readers will respond by asking, œIf you are so smart about health decisions, why did you end up in the ER? A fair question, given that road biking is not always safe and perhaps ****ogous to drinking sugared colas. I am trying, as I stare up at the ceiling, to weigh the odds of crashes versus the health benefits of riding, versus the enjoyment versus alternative workout regimens, versus just sticking to yard and farm work, versus trying everything from a fat-tire slow bike to stationary biking. Two bits of advice I hear from friends: œYou have to get right back at it and conquer your anxieties. Versus: œWake up   is road biking necessary? Try walking more.
A farmer 10 miles away, who was a father of four children, was shot and killed this week after investigating intruders on his farm. (The gang-banger suspects are now in custody.) He interrupted a stolen car being stripped, and œthey killed him for being so rude as to drive on his own land. I note that fact because a few weeks ago the dogs barked at 3 a.m. For once I decided to ignore them. And the next morning I found a stripped auto in my vineyard. I had gone back to sleep on the theory that in America today walking out to investigate would have been a politically incorrect sin.
Here is what I mean. America does not like the enforcement of property rights unless one is rich, hip and cool, like those who assume the sanctity of their Google or Apple parking lots. I would de facto have no right to have ordered people off my property. And without arms, no means of enforcing any order I had issued. Instead, I assume California would argue that there must have been extenuating circumstances that forced the gang-bangers into a life of crime, from callous indifference about their impoverishment to illegal-alien bashing (to, well, fill in the blanks).
For all practical purposes, one has no right to arm oneself to protect property. If I were unarmed and shot, I would be assumed to have been foolish by venturing out on my own property. If I were armed, and yet got shot confronting thieves, the media would say that I was more foolish and trigger-happy and prompted the violence. If I had shot them in self-defense, I would appear a paranoid old white male who privileged property over human life   and be sued by their families who had access to free legal help. If I were to call 9/11, I would expect that the response would be slow, given that in the hierarchy of a night's epidemic of central California felonies, a stripped auto would rank low.
So I went back to sleep, and called the sheriff the next day when I discovered the stripped auto. Someone else who was more courageous was murdered this week. We lost a brave citizen, and now deal with his murderers, on behalf of whom the resources of a bankrupt society will be amply invested.
If only Nancy Pelosi or Jeb Bush would come down to a Central Valley ER in these parts, or try farming when a vineyard become a veritable chop shop, they would not so easily lecture others on their supposed illiberality. Otherwise, the liberal view is a make-believe land of elites who are exempt from the wages of their ideology, as others deemed less sophisticated and liberal bear their consequences.
The move comes after increased pressure on the former real estate mogul to admit that after all this time, President Obama is in fact a natural born citizen. It also came at the end of a lengthy bait-and-switch with the mainstream media; all of the major cable news network carried the press conference waiting for the œbirther element. However, the presser was focused instead on military endorsements from Medal of Honor recipients, many of whom spoke at length about their support for Trump's candidacy.
Then, as dramatically as ever and with the dexterity of ultimate showmanship, Trump devoted just the final seconds to mentioning the very topic that everyone was waiting for.
Yesterday, the Trump campaign itself released a statement acknowledging that Trump believes in Obama's Hawaii birth; senior communications advisor Jason Miller said yesterday, œHaving successfully obtained President Obama's birth certificate when others could not, Mr. Trump believes that President Obama was born in the United States.
As recently as two days ago however, the Republican party nominee refused to outright admit that he believed President Obama was born in the United States. He told the Washington Post Wednesday night, œI'll answer that question at the right time. I just don't want to answer it yet.
In 2011 at the beginning of the so-called œbirther movement, Donald Trump claimed to have sent a team of investigators to Hawaii to perhaps uncover what he described as, œone of the greatest cons in the history of politics and beyond.
œI have people that have been studying it and they cannot believe what they're finding, he said at the time.
In a leaked personal email that was released earlier this week, former Secretary of State Colin Powell asserted definitively, œYup, the whole birther movement was racist.
Drew Altman, the president and chief executive of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health research group, said the message of the polled seemed to be: œ ˜We may not like Obamacare very much, but don't take my brother's or sister's or niece's Medicaid coverage away.' It's like there's an ideological side of people's brains but a practical side, too, that values the health benefits and the coverage.
The Affordable Care Act gave states the option of expanding their Medicaid program to include all people younger than 65 with income at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or $16,243 for a single person. Before the law's passage, enrollment was limited almost exclusively to children, pregnant women and the disabled.
Kentucky's former governor, Steven L. Beshear, a Democrat, expanded the program by executive order in January 2014, and since then, an additional 425,000 residents have joined the Medicaid rolls, most of them adults. By contrast, only 89,000 people have bought private coverage through Kynect, the state's health care exchange.
Sources told ESPN.com that Ellis and the Pacers have verbally agreed to a four-year deal worth $44 million that includes an option for the shooting guard to return to free agency after Year 3.
Editor's Picks Pelton: Breaking down Day 2 free-agent deals D-Wade and the Heat compromised, the Bucks upgraded with Greg Monroe and the Mavs took a risk with Wesley Matthews. Kevin Pelton sorts through the second day of free agency.
The Pacers' push to sign Ellis was at the behest of team president Larry Bird, who led a contingent of team officials that dined with Ellis on Wednesday night. The Pacers are looking to play at a faster tempo and have been looking for some time for more scoring punch in the backcourt.
Ellis turned down a larger offer from the Sacramento Kings, who offered him a four-year, $48 million deal, sources said.
In addition to the opportunity to play with Pacers star Paul George, Ellis was drawn to Indiana because of its proximity to Memphis, Tennessee, hometown of his wife Juanika, who plans to attend law school in Indianapolis. Ellis also has two children living in Memphis, which is a 4 1/2 hour drive from Indianapolis.
Count On Ellis Being Clutch Monta Ellis can be relied on for scoring late in games. Only James Harden scored more points in clutch time (last five minutes of fourth quarter/overtime with score within five points) than Ellis last season. Player Clutch Points James Harden 138 Monta Ellis 135 John Wall 132 LaMarcus Aldridge 124 Russell Westbrook 123 -- ESPN Stats & Information
"This is absolutely the best fit for Monta on the court and Monta's family off the court and in all circumstances involving a young family,'' said Jeff Fried, Ellis' agent. "Our goal was to have the entire family unit come out winners on this deal and that is what we believe we accomplished."
Ellis didn't exercise the final year of his deal with the Mavericks last month, forgoing $8.7 million and opting instead for free agency.
The 29-year-old averaged 18.9 points last season to become the first player other than Dirk Nowitzki to lead the Dallas Mavericks in scoring since 1999-2000. He also averaged 4.1 assists per game.
A 10-year veteran, Ellis has a career scoring average of 19.3 points per game, the highest in NBA history among players who never have been an All-Star.
Ellis signed with the Mavs in the summer of 2013 after declining an $11 million player option for the final season of his previous contract and turning down a three-year, $36 million offer to remain with the Milwaukee Bucks. He settled for a three-year, $25 million deal from Dallas with a player option for the final season.
The 6-foot-3 Ellis, an undersized shooting guard who is one of the league's most dynamic off-the-dribble threats, played a key role in the Mavs' winning a total of 99 games and advancing to the playoffs in each of the past two seasons after Dallas' one-year postseason absence.
However, his moodiness was cited by several team sources as a factor in the Mavs' chemistry issues last season.
The prince campaigns vociferously for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and recently attacked the global food industry over the problems caused "when we ship vast quantities of commodities halfway round the world". But he has used the proceeds from the export of bottles of Duchy Originals water from a Scottish estate close to Balmoral to luxury supermarkets in the Gulf to fund his favoured charities. It is part of a sales drive for the prince's groceries brand in conjunction with Waitrose which has delivered Â£10m in profits over the past three years.
Luxury Duchy Originals hampers, including bottles of lemon and ginger drinks, are also on sale at the SuperNature grocery 10,000 miles away by sea in Singapore, while bottles of Duchy-branded organic ale made with barley from the prince's Home Farm at Highgrove are being offered by drinks retailers in Australia and New Zealand.
Environmentalists have called for the prince to bring the trade to an immediate halt. "Shipping bottles of water around the world is completely insane," said Craig Bennett, director of policy and campaigns at Friends of the Earth.
"It is absolutely ludicrous when there is perfectly good drinking water in the Middle East. It is very hard to dress up shipping water thousands of miles as helping the environment."
The story has emerged 52 months after Charles made an apocalyptic speech in Rio de Janeiro warning that the world had "less than 100 months to alter our behaviour before we risk catastrophic climate change".
The Royal Deeside water is shipped from Aberdeenshire to branches of Spinneys in Dubai, Bahrain and Abu Dhabi. Waitrose declined to say how much goes to the Gulf because of "commercial sensitivity" but said it was "very small". One thousand cases sent via the Suez c**** would produce an estimated 1.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide.
Jeanette Longfield, co-ordinator of Sustain, a campaign for sustainable food policies, said shipping water was "lunacy". "Once this is drawn to Prince Charles's attention I would hope he will decide this is not a good idea," she said.
Prince Charles has cast himself as a protector of the environment. Duchy Originals, set up by the prince in 1990 "to promote organic food and farming and to help protect and sustain the countryside and wildlife", began exporting in earnest after signing the Waitrose deal. It publishes a charter that explains: "We aim for the smallest environmental footprint."
The Prince of Wales's Charitable Foundation last year gave Â£200,000 to the Soil association, which campaigns to "minimise the local and global ecological footprint" of food.
A spokesman for the prince said: "The Prince of Wales is aware that Waitrose is committed to reducing its environmental impact wherever possible. Duchy Originals from Waitrose has so far donated around Â£3m a year to the Prince's Charitable Foundation, a grant-giving charity, and to the Prince's Countryside Fund, which supports Britain's hard pressed rural communities."
The majority of royalties are generated from the sale of Duchy products in UK supermarkets but profits of around Â£45,000 came from exports, including some that are air-freighted.
A spokeswoman for Waitrose said: "We are committed to reducing our environmental impact. The vast majority of products we export are sea-freighted, with less than 1% of our Duchy Originals from Waitrose exports air-freighted, which makes sense from an environmental and a commercial perspective." Waitrose said it did not directly supply Duchy Originals hampers to Singapore or Duchy beer to the Middle East.
Thanks to what could very well be the deepest class to come along in years, the 2014 NFL draft promises to be jam-packed with excitement from start to finish. With so many top-notch prospects ready to make the leap to the next level, it is certainly possible for every team to make marked improvements.
Of the NFL's 32 teams, 30 have at least one pick in the first round, and they have to be feeling confident in terms of nabbing a future star. There are inevitably going to be some slip-ups along the way, but all of those teams have a golden opportunity in front of them.
Along with a full first-round mock draft, here is some further ****ysis regarding how every first-round team will improve by virtue of the 2014 draft.
1. Houston Texans (2-14): Teddy Bridgewater, QB, Louisville
After Matt Schaub and Case Keenum threw away the Texans' season, there is no question that they desperately need a franchise quarterback. Bridgewater has all the tools necessary to be a Pro Bowl signal-caller at the next level.
2. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (projected trade with STL from WAS): Jadeveon Clowney, DE, South Carolina
The Rams are in an extremely advantageous position at No. 2, with several teams likely dying to move up in order to select Clowney. St. Louis can demand a king's ransom, which the Buccaneers will ultimately pay so new head coach Lovie Smith can have a true defensive weapon.
3. Jacksonville Jaguars (4-12): Blake Bortles, QB, UCF
Perhaps no team in the NFL has had a worse quarterback situation than the Jags over the past several years. Jacksonville will have a few intriguing options to consider at No. 3, but it will ultimately stay in state by going with Bortles out of UCF.
4. Cleveland Browns (4-12): Johnny Manziel, QB, Texas A&M
There is no getting around the fact that the Cleveland Browns have to find themselves a quarterback of the future. The Brandon Weeden experiment was an obvious failure, and Jason Campbell and Brian Hoyer aren't long-term options. As much as the Browns need a quarterback, though, they also need a face of the franchise fans can get excited about. If the top three picks go as expected, Cleveland will have the perfect player fall into its lap in the form of Johnny Manziel.
It seems as though every talent evaluator feels differently about Johnny Football's ability to translate his skill set to the NFL, but he is worth gambling on. He proved his toughness and will to win while at Texas A&M, and he pulled off some of the most amazing plays in recent memory. Dual-threat quarterbacks are the new flavor in the NFL, so there is reason to believe Manziel can succeed. Also, if the reports are to be believed, the Browns feel good about Manziel's NFL prospects too, according to Fox Sports Ohio.
Whichever team ends up with Manziel is going to have a ton of buzz surrounding it. That alone could be enough to convince the Browns. They have been so bad for so long that they need to do something huge in order to inspire confidence from the fans. Drafting Manziel is clearly the best option in that regard. Add the fact that Manziel has a chance to be the best NFL quarterback from this class, and it's truly an obvious pick from Cleveland's perspective.
5. Oakland Raiders (4-12): Jake Matthews, OT, Texas A&M
The Raiders could potentially be gun shy when it comes to selecting an offensive tackle high in the first round after Robert Gallery busted in 2004, but it is a definite need, and it can be argued that Matthews is the safest prospect in the entire draft.
6. Atlanta Falcons (4-12): Greg Robinson, OT, Auburn
Matthews may be the safest, but Robinson has the highest ceiling of any offensive tackle available. He was instrumental in an Auburn running game that led the nation, and he would be hugely helpful to a Falcons team that often gets pushed around in the trenches.
7. St. Louis Rams (Projected Trade with TB): Sammy Watkins, WR, Clemson
One reason the Rams can afford to trade down from No. 2 is the fact that this deep draft class ensures a great prospect will be available at No. 7. That comes to fruition with the Rams selecting Sammy Watkins to pair with 2013 first-round pick Tavon Austin at wide receiver.
8. Minnesota Vikings (5-10-1): Anthony Barr, OLB, UCLA
The fact that Barr is very likely to be available at this juncture says a lot about the star power within this draft class. It remains to be seen what type of defense the Vikings will employ, since they don't currently have a coaching staff in place, but Barr would be too good to pass up.
9. Buffalo Bills (6-10): Khalil Mack, OLB, Buffalo
No NFL team has had more opportunities to watch Mack over the past couple of years than the Bills. Mack put together a fantastic collegiate career and is now garnering national attention. Buffalo would be wise to keep him at home, as he could bolster a fast-rising defensive unit led by Mike Pettine.
10. Detroit Lions (7-9): Darqueze Dennard, CB, Michigan State
Gregory Shamus/Getty Images
Detroit's defense has the potential to be great thanks to a dominant front four, but it needs some players who can cover in the secondary. Dennard is undoubtedly the best cover corner in this draft, and he makes a ton of sense for the Lions at No. 10.
11. Tennessee Titans (7-9): C.J. Mosley, ILB, Alabama
The Titans are solid in several areas but dominant in none. In order to stop hovering around the .500 mark, Tennessee needs a true impact player, and Mosley is a guy who can take charge and change the entire complexion of its defense.
12. New York Giants (7-9): Cyrus Kouandjio, OT, Alabama
As bad as he looked in 2013, quarterback Eli Manning is the key to the Giants' success moving forward. He isn't mobile, so protecting him his absolutely paramount, and Kouandjio would be up to the task after keeping A.J. McCarron off the ground at Alabama.
13. St. Louis Rams (7-9): Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, S, Alabama
Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images
After addressing a need on offense, the Rams now have an opportunity to take care of their biggest hole on defense. The safety position gave up too many big plays in 2013, but Clinton-Dix would almost certainly nip that in the bud.
14. Chicago Bears (8-8): Kony Ealy, DE, Missouri
Chicago's defensive issues up front contributed directly to missing the playoffs in 2013, but Ealy could change things significantly in 2014 by generating a pass rush in his own right while also opening things up for Julius Peppers on the other side.
15. Pittsburgh Steelers (8-8): Justin Gilbert, CB, Oklahoma State
The Steelers looked great offensively down the stretch this past season, but their defense was uncharacteristically shaky. Cornerback Keenan Lewis signing with the New Orleans Saints hurt Pittsburgh badly, but Gilbert should be able to render that loss moot.
16. Baltimore Ravens (8-8 pending coin flip): Mike Evans, WR, Texas A&M
Quarterback Joe Flacco deserves some blame for the Ravens' failure to make the playoffs in 2013, especially after signing a monster contract in the offseason. With that said, his supporting cast was depleted, but a big, athletic playmaker such as Evans would put him back in a position to succeed.
17. Dallas Cowboys (8-8 pending coin flip): Ra'Shede Hageman, DL, Minnesota
The Cowboys always seem to have one of the best groups of skill-position players heading into every season, but that never gets them anywhere. They need to start building their lines up in order to win the little battles, and Hageman will help immensely in that regard.
18. New York Jets (8-8): Jace Amaro, TE, Texas Tech
Quarterback Geno Smith is doomed to fail unless the Jets go out and get him some help, so taking a pass-catcher at No. 18 is integral. There are a few solid options, but Amaro makes the most sense because Smith should be able to trust him in almost any situation.
19. Miami Dolphins (8-8): Cameron Erving, OT, Florida State
Perhaps no team in this draft has a more glaring weakness than the Dolphins. Quarterback Ryan Tannehill ate the turf far too often in 2013, but Erving should help immensely after keeping Heisman Trophy winner Jameis Winston out of harm's way at Florida State.
20. Arizona Cardinals (10-6): Taylor Lewan, OT, Michigan
The offensive line has seemingly been a huge topic of conversation for years in Arizona, and while it wasn't exactly awful in 2013, it could take a big step forward next season with the addition of a polished tackle such as Lewan.
21. Green Bay Packers (8-7-1): Stephon Tuitt, DL, Notre Dame
Green Bay's defensive line could look totally different next season, as several key players will be hitting free agency, but Tuitt would definitely stem the tide thanks to his pass-rushing ability and penchant for taking up blockers in a 3-4 scheme.
22. Philadelphia Eagles (10-6): Jason Verrett, CB, TCU
Philadelphia's defense certainly made some strides in 2013, but there is no question that it remains the team's weak link. Pass defense was an issue at various times throughout the season, but Verrett could potentially put a stop to that.
23. Kansas City Chiefs (11-5): Marqise Lee, WR, USC
Most people will likely remember the fact that the Kansas City Chiefs' 2013 season ended in severe disappointment when the team blew a 28-point lead against the Indianapolis Colts in the playoffs, but that shouldn't negate what they accomplished. After selecting No. 1 in the 2013 NFL draft, the Chiefs went 11-5 and reestablished themselves as players in the AFC. The play of quarterback Alex Smith was a big reason for that.
Head coach Andy Reid utilized Smith as more of a caretaker than anything early in the season, but the offense really opened up late in the year, and Smith put up some impressive numbers. He was fantastic in the narrow loss to Indy, but his defense ultimately failed him. Smith may have the tools necessary to be a Pro Bowler, but he could use a little bit of help. Wide receiver Marqise Lee would be a huge steal at this juncture, and he would add another dimension to KC's offense, as seen in this video courtesy of Pac-12 Networks.
With running back Jamaal Charles doing it all and wide receiver Dwayne Bowe getting the job done on the other side of the field, Lee would add a much-needed third option to the offense. It would also allow Donnie Avery to slot in as the No. 3 receiver, which would strengthen the offense as a whole significantly. Lee is a potential game-breaker at the next level, and he could be the last missing piece in terms of elevating Smith to top-10 status.
24. Cincinnati Bengals (11-5): Bradley Roby, CB, Ohio State
The Bengals defense showed some chinks in the armor during the playoffs after suffering through a number of injuries during the regular season, so there is no question that depth is needed throughout the unit. Cornerback is a great place to start, and Roby seems like a good fit.
25. San Diego Chargers (9-7): Zack Martin, OG, Notre Dame
San Diego possesses a fine offensive nucleus, but it needs some help in the trenches in order to truly thrive. Martin is easily the top guard in this draft, and he will make life much easier for Philip Rivers, Ryan Mathews, et al.
26. Cleveland Browns (from 11-5 Indianapolis Colts): Ka'Deem Carey, RB, Arizona
Taking a running back at any point in the first round seems like a reach these days, but aside from quarterback, there is no doubt that running back is the Browns' biggest need. Manziel will need a running game to support him, and Carey can provide it.
27. New Orleans Saints (11-5): Ryan Shazier, OLB, Ohio State
In order for the Saints to excel on the road, they need to continue building on the defensive side of the ball. Shazier can truly do it all as an outside linebacker, and he would be a fantastic complement to Curtis Lofton in the middle.
28. Carolina Panthers (12-4): Kelvin Benjamin, WR, Florida State
One thing that became evident during the Panthers' playoff loss to the 49ers was the fact that quarterback Cam Newton needs some help. Steve Smith and Greg Olsen are nice targets, but they aren't elite players. Benjamin has the potential to become one thanks to his combination of size and explosiveness.
29. New England Patriots (12-4): Cyril Richardson, OG, Baylor
The Patriots appear to be evolving, as the power running game has been their bread and butter in recent weeks. Nabbing a big guard such as Richardson will aid in that evolution, and he'll help keep quarterback Tom Brady's uniform clean as well.
30. San Francisco 49ers (12-4): Odell Beckham Jr., WR, LSU
San Francisco pretty much has it all, but a deep threat for quarterback Colin Kaepernick couldn't hurt. A.J. Jenkins simply didn't work out a couple of years ago, but there is reason to believe Beckham will be a success due to his polish.
31. Denver Broncos (13-3): Antonio Richardson, OT, Tennessee
Quarterback Peyton Manning's health will be a question mark until he retires, and the only way to ensure his health is by preventing him from getting sacked. The Broncos have done a solid job in that regard, but Richardson would make it even tougher on opposing defenses.
32. Seattle Seahawks (13-3): Eric Ebron, TE, North Carolina
Streeter Lecka/Getty Images
Many would argue that the Seattle Seahawks are the most complete team in the NFL, which means they have the luxury of doing pretty much whatever they please with their first-round draft pick. Quarterback Russell Wilson continued to develop in his second season, and he did so without any truly elite options in the passing game. The return of a healthy Percy Harvin helps immensely, but getting him a dangerous weapon at tight end such as Eric Ebron would be a major coup.
Wilson has made the most of Zach Miller and Luke Willson at tight end; however, they aren't exactly dynamic players. Ebron certainly is, and his presence would open things up for the wide receivers as well as running back Marshawn Lynch. Ebron recently signed with agent Bus Cook, and Cook had high praise for the likely first-round selection, according to Rick Cleveland of the Sun Herald.
"Don't be surprised if Eric's the next great NFL tight end," Cook said.
Cook has represented some incredible, Hall of Fame-caliber players, so his opinion is worth taking note of. Cook could prove prophetic if Ebron lands in Seattle. Opposing defenses already have so much to worry about that Ebron would likely find himself open quite often in the Seahawks offense. Add the continued progression of Wilson, and Ebron is a perfect fit.
The cases have provided lots of cable-television drama, from Private Manning's court-martial to Moscow's provocative granting of temporary asylum to America's best-known fugitive. But the deeper lessons lie in how the government is stumbling in its efforts to protect its secrets in the Internet age. Washington has still not heeded two decades of warnings that the best way to protect America's biggest secrets is to have far fewer of them and to recognize that much of what is stamped œsecret today is widely available on the Internet.
There are certainly some secrets the government needs to protect, but many of the most important clues about revolutions, nuclear transfers and new military sites can be found online, in open chat rooms and commercial satellite photos.

So now Donald Trump is saying that Barack Obama tapped his phones, as if he's interesting enough to monitor. Let's also acknowledge that Trump is a bulk-tweeting reality TV personality who loves to air all of his divisive, misogynistic, controversial genital-grabbing comments, so a grain of salt for anything he says is well-deserved.
Last week Trump called for the Department of Justice to run a full investigation on the former president and his alleged role in ordering an unlawful investigation. Like many angry kids, Trump ran to Twitter stating, "How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones"   yeah, he can't spell tap   "... during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/ Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!"

He continued his rant with a few more tweets about Obama and wire tapping. I guess someone gifted The Donald a box set of David Simon's HBO series "The Wire", and that gave him new ammo to create drama in an attempt to shift negative attention away from his failing administration. Government officials aren't buying it, including FBI director James B. Comey, who asked the Justice Department to publicly reject the president's claims.
Thought the Soviet Union was anti-American? Try today's Russia.
After a year in which furious rhetoric has been pumped across Russian airwaves, anger toward the United States is at its worst since opinion polls began tracking it. From ordinary street vendors all the way up to the Kremlin, a wave of anti-U.S. bile has swept the country, surpassing any time since the Stalin era, observers say.
The indignation peaked after the assassination of Kremlin critic Boris Nemtsov, as conspiracy theories started to swirl   just a few hours after he was killed   that his death was a CIA plot to discredit Russia. (On Sunday, Russia charged two men from Chechnya, and detained three others, in connection with Nemtsov's killing.)
There are drives to exchange Western-branded clothing for Russia's red, blue and white. Efforts to replace Coke with Russian-made soft drinks. Fury over U.S. sanctions. And a passionate, conspiracy-laden fascination with the methods that Washington is supposedly using to foment unrest in Ukraine and Russia.
The anger is a challenge for U.S. policymakers seeking to reach out to a shrinking pool of friendly faces in Russia. And it is a marker of the limits of their ability to influence Russian decision-making after a year of sanctions. More than 80 percent of Russians now hold negative views of the United States, according to the independent Levada Center, a number that has more than doubled over the past year and that is by far the highest negative rating since the center started tracking those views in 1988.

Nemtsov's assassination, the highest-profile political killing during VladiÂ­mir Putin's 15 years in power, was yet another brutal strike against pro-Western forces in Russia. Nemtsov had long modeled himself on Western politicians and amassed a long list of enemies who resented him for it.
The anti-Western anger stands to grow even stronger if President Obama decides to send lethal weaponry to the Ukrainian military, as he has been considering. The aim would be to œraise the cost of any Russian intervention by making the Ukrainian response more lethal. But even some of Putin's toughest critics say they cannot support that proposal, since the cost is the lives of their nation's soldiers.
[U.S. military vehicles paraded 300 yards from the Russian border]
œThe United States is experimenting geopolitically, using people like guinea pigs, said Sergey Mikheev, director of the Kremlin-allied Center for Current Politics, on a popular talk show on the state-run First Channel last year. His accusations, drawn out by a host who said it was important to œknow the enemy, were typical of the rhetoric that fills Russian airwaves.
œThey treat us all in the same way, threatening not only world stability but the existence of every human being on the planet, Mikheev said.
Soviet rhetoric was officially anti-Western, but it couldn't repress ordinary Russians' passion for the Beatles or their enthusiasm for getting news from jammed Voice of America broadcasts. Those positive feelings spilled over after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.
But the list of perceived slights from the United States has long been building, particularly after the United States and NATO bombed Serbia, a Russian ally, in 1999. Then came the war in Iraq, NATO expansion and the Russia-Georgia conflict. Each time, there were smaller spikes of anti-American sentiment that receded as quickly as they emerged.
Putin cranked up the volume after protest movements in late 2011 and 2012, which he blamed on the State Department. It wasn't until last year, when the crisis started in Ukraine, that anti-Americanism spread even among those who once eagerly hopped on planes to Miami and Los Angeles.
Fed by the powerful antagonism on Russian federal television channels, the main source of news for more than 90 percent of Russians, ordinary people started to feel more and more disillusioned. The anger seems different from the fast-receding jolts of the past, observers say, having spread faster and wider.
The years of perceived humiliations have œled to anti-Americanism at the grass-roots level, which did not exist before, said Vladimir Pozner, a journalist who for decades was a prominent voice of the Soviet Union in the United States. More recently, he has to explain the United States inside Russia. œWe don't like the Americans, and it's because they're pushy, they think they're unique and they have had no regard for anyone else.
Anti-American measures quickly suffused the nation, ranging from the symbolic to the truly significant. Some coffee shops in Crimea stopped serving Americanos. Activists projected racially charged images of Obama eating a banana onto the side of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. Russians cheerfully flocked to exchange Western-branded clothing for Â­T-shirts with pictures of an Iskander missile launcher that said œSanctions? Don't make my Iskander laugh.

œThis anti-Western propaganda radically changed the atmosphere in the society, said Lev Gudkov, the director of the Levada Center, the opinion polling firm. œIt has become militarist.
Many Russians tapped into a deep-rooted resentment that after modeling themselves on the West following the breakup of the Soviet Union, they had experienced only hardship and humiliation in return.
œStarting from about 1989, we completely reoriented toward the West. We looked at them as a future paradise. We expected that once we had done all that they demanded, we'd dance for them and they would finally hug and kiss us and we would merge in ecstasy, said Evgeny Tarlo, a member of Russia's upper house of parliament, on a Russian talk show last year. Instead, he said, the West has been trying to destroy Russia.
The anti-Americanism makes it harder for American culture to make inroads through its traditional means   soft-power routes such as movies, music and education. Last year, Russian policymakers ended a decades-old high school exchange program that offered their nation's best and brightest the chance to spend semesters at U.S. schools. Few Western artists now perform on Russian soil.
Western diplomats also say privately that they find themselves frozen out of speaking engagements and other opportunities to explain their countries' positions to Russian audiences. And Russians who work for local outposts of Western companies say their friends and neighbors increasingly question their patriotism.
A handful of business leaders have warned that Russia risks permanently stunting its own economic development with the angry self-isolation.
œI worry that the recent crisis might drive Russia into a certain historic confrontation, hampering the country's development in all spheres, said former finance minister and Putin ally Alexey Kudrin in an interview with Tass.
But those are lonely voices amid the torrent of anti-Western fury.
œWhat the government knew was that it was very easy to cultivate anti-Western sentiments, and it was easy to consolidate Russian society around this propaganda, said Maria Lipman, an independent Moscow-based political ****yst who is working on a study of anti-Western attitudes.
Even McDonald's, long an embodiment of Russian dreams about the West, was targeted for supposed health violations in the fall. Some of its most prominent locations were forced to shut down temporarily. When they reopened, McDonald's started an advertising campaign emphasizing its local ties and its 25-year history in Russia, playing down the Golden Arches' global significance as a bright beacon of America.
Last week, one McDonald's billboard in the heart of Moscow read: œMade in Russia, for Russians.

Later this year JetBlue planes with Fly-Fi broadband Internet service, which currently is in a beta-test phase, will open access to Amazon Prime subscribers. Normally, the Fly-Fi service is $9 per hour, while the airline's free Wi-Fi is not robust enough allow video streaming.
œWe want to provide the best digital video experience to our customers and we're excited that with JetBlue, we will raise the bar in airline entertainment, said Michael Paull, Amazon's VP of digital video.
Amazon Prime ($99 per year) provides free two-day shipping on millions of items, as well as access to thousands of titles on Prime Instant Video, including Golden Globe-winning original series œTransparent (pictured above).
JetBlue's Fly-Fi system uses satellite-delivered Internet to provide speeds comparable to wireline broadband service. Amazon and JetBlue said they collaborated to ensure that the in-flight entertainment system will be able to deliver high-quality streaming for movies and TV episodes from Amazon. JetBlue's Fly-Fi will be available on all JetBlue's Airbus A321 and A320 aircraft this year, and on JetBlue's Embraer E190 aircraft in 2016.
For JetBlue, the pact is part of its effort to stand out from bigger rivals like American Airlines and Delta. Passenger perks on JetBlue include free unlimited snacks and beverages.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Pakistani man convicted in March in a U.S. court of conspiring with al Qaeda to bomb a shopping centre in Manchester, England should spend 30 years to life in prison, U.S. prosecutors said.
Abid Naseer, 29, poses an "extreme danger" to society given his "continued commitment" to cause mass casualties designed to rival the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, prosecutors said in a letter filed late Tuesday night.
Naseer had represented himself at trial, and is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 17 by U.S. District Judge Raymond Dearie in Brooklyn, New York.
Naseer was convicted of plotting to blow up the Arndale shopping centre in the centre of Manchester as early as April 2009, when he was arrested by British authorities.
The attack was one of three that U.S. prosecutors said affiliated cells were working on, including attacks against the New York City subway and a Copenhagen newspaper.
Najibullah Zazi, who pleaded guilty in the New York plot, testified against Naseer that both men coordinated their plans through coded emails with an al Qaeda operative in Pakistan.
Raised in Peshawar, the well-educated Naseer he said he had a happy childhood in a stable suburban family and became proficient at cricket. Prosecutors said this made his the "rare case" where no extenuating circumstances mitigated his crimes.
"He was given every opportunity in life, rendering his behaviour all the more abhorrent," prosecutors said. "There is simply nothing in the record, nor in the defendant's own statements about his family and upbringing, that allows the blame for the defendant's choice to join al-Qaeda to be placed anywhere other than squarely at his own two feet."
James Neuman, a lawyer representing Naseer for the sentencing, said in an Oct. 20 court filing that a sentence "significantly below" 30 years was appropriate.
He said his client's background, and support from family and friends, left "every reason to conclude that Mr. Naseer will never commit another crime, let alone anything related to terrorism."
Neuman declined comment on Wednesday on the government's sentencing request.
The case is U.S. v. Naseer, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 10-cr-00019.
Originally announced at CES this year, the new Philips 4K TVs are set to launch starting today. The new sets feature support for Chromecast and Google Home technology, as well as High Dynamic Range and voice command support. Head below for more details.
The new 5000-series Philips 4K TVs feature built-in Chromecast tech, which allows users to stream content from a smartphone or tablet (or anything that supports it) directly to the 4K display with no additional logins or technical setup required. According to Philips, there are more than 1,000 apps that support Chromecast which offers access to an estimated 200,000 TV shows and films as well as about 30 million songs and more. The company also notes that any mobile device streaming content to your new 5000-series 4K display can also be used for other tasks at the same time including social media and taking/receiving calls.
While details on the entire system are thin, these new 4K displays work with Google Home and Google assistant. That means you'll be able to control your new entertainment hub with nothing but your voice. Philips says a new feature for Chromecast will display information on the screen via voice commands through Google assistant, but that won't become available until 2018.
As far as actual picture quality, Philips is focusing on the HDR or High Dynamic Range. It will apparently, significantly enhance brightness levels as well as color and contrast performance. In my experience, HDR certainly looks good, but I'm not sure I would ever be able to tell the difference without A/B-ing two displays side-by-side. Nonetheless, it is the way of the future and will likely become standard on every display in time, especially considering Microsoft and Sony (among other companies) are starting to attempt to bring that kind of tech to the mainstream.
Beyond that, you can expect Philips 120 Perfect Motion Rate. That's essentially the company's own take on a typical 120Hz refresh rate to support high-motion content and fast moving images on the display. HDMI 2.0a with œHDCP2.2 on all HDMI ports and built-in HEVC and VP9 decoders means you can connect that 4K Blu-ray player, satellite, gaming consoles and well pretty much anything.
If you thought global Chinese travelers were already spending jaw-dropping amounts worldwide, you haven't seen anything yet, according to a new report by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. By 2019, the report finds, the global travel industry is poised to see an influx of Chinese spending worth some $264 billion, much of that powered by China's younger generation.
By 2019, BoA Merrill Lynch estimates, the number of outbound Chinese travelers will surge to 174 million, a sizable increase from 2014, when 109 million ventured abroad and spent $164 billion. To put this in perspective, the report notes that $264 billion is roughly the size of Finland's entire economy (and bigger than that of Greece).
The main demographic driving spending growth in the next five years will be Chinese millennials, defined as 25- to 34-year-olds, which comprise 35 percent of all outbound Chinese tourists. Younger travelers aged 15 to 24 are another vital demographic, accounting for an additional 27 percent.
So what does this mean? It means it's vital for the global travel and retail industries to understand the demands of this demographic, which is set to revolutionize the way Chinese tourists travel and shop. Current trends offer a glimpse at how China's young traveler will behave at home and abroad in the years ahead. As experience becomes an increasingly important priority for Chinese travelers, they'll allocate more of their budgets toward activities and dining, while opting for far-flung or exotic destinations over the well-worn global tourist hubs. However, this doesn't mean they won't want to show off to friends on the contrary, sharing experiences to social media will remain a fundamental component of trips.
The hemorrhagic disease is half a world away, but when scientists study Ebola and how it spreads, they often look to Reston.
That's right, Reston, Va. There is a strain of Ebola called œEbola Reston, because it was discovered here in 1990.
There are five types of Ebola that can **** humans. Ebola Reston was discovered to only **** moneys, though
However, that discovery came after a serious medical investigation, chronicled in the book The Hot Zone.
Here's what happened
In the fall of 1989, Hazelton Laboratories had a lab at 1946 Isaac Newton Square West, where KinderCare is now located. The lab did animal experiments.
There were already about 500 macaque monkeys housed at the facility when 100 more were flown from the Philippines, according to an article in the Internet Journal of Preventative Medicine.
A month later, 29 of the 100 quarantined monkeys had died. During a necropsy, a veterinarian found one monkey's spleen had tripled in size and hardened and there was blood in the intestines. After conducting several other necropsies he diagnosed the deaths as being caused by simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), the Journal article said.
The Hazelton facility veterinarian then sent samples of the monkey tissues to the United States Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) for a conclusive diagnosis. Meanwhile, Hazelton lab workers began euthanizing the remaining animals, but sporadic deaths began occurring in several other rooms. Soon, 30 monkeys from a different shipment were dead.
More from the Journal
Back at USAMRIID another researcher discovered by electron microscopy that Ebola Zaire was responsible for the monkey deaths. On Nov. 28, 1989 nearly six weeks after monkeys began dying in Reston, USAMRIID verified the Ebola finding. The following day, representatives from USAMRIID, the CDC, and the Virginia Department of Health met and developed an action plan. The CDC would handle people; USAMRIID would handle the monkeys and the monkey facility. Because of the threat that Ebola might spread to staff, Reston, and the greater Washington, DC community, the Army determined that all remaining monkeys would be immediately euthanized. The first task was to determine how best to administer a solution to a building potentially full of Ebola.
Scientists came to Reston in hazmat suits in order to carefully euthanize monkeys and stop the spread of the disease. During the process one of the monkeys escaped.
œSeveral of us spent the better part of a day trying to catch it, Dr. Jerry Jaax said in a veterinary medical journal interview. œWhen we talk about the Reston incident, we compare the frustration of that day with the Hollywood version in the movie ˜Outbreak,' in which an infected monkey was coaxed from a tree and captured within minutes. It is a great example of reality vs. Hollywood.' 
The runaway was later caught in the building.
Then the decontamination efforts began   an 11-day operation of scrubbing and bleaching. That was followed by electric frying pans cooking formaldehyde crystals for three days to rid the air of all toxins.
In the end, researchers concluded that the new species of Ebola was highly contagious in monkeys but not in humans. They also learned that the disease was not only found in Africa, since the monkeys had come from the Philippines. The investigators determined aerosol transmission was particularly quick in a lab setting, because the virus appeared to pass between rooms to infect susceptible monkeys.
The monkeys from Reston had an impact in Ebola research since doctors were able to study their diseased or exposed-to-disease bodies.
The first big event was the Society of Environmental Journalists (SEJ) annual conference. Then came the greatly anticipated Climate Reality Leadership Corps training, with more than 1,300 trainees from around the world, led by founder and former Vice President Al Gore. October closed with the Natural History Museums in the Age of Humanity conference at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, coinciding with the opening of its We Are Nature: Living in the Anthropocene exhibit about life in the time of climate change.
By the end of these extraordinary gatherings, however, I kept wondering whether the truth about our region's environment is getting lost. Why were our region's very serious existing and potential environmental and health issues not being prominently acknowledged and recognized during these events?
Were conference-goers being greenwashed?
At the SEJ conference, sponsored by University of Pittsburgh's Swanson School of Engineering, attendees were welcomed by a large display emblazoned with the potentially misleading message, "How the ˜Smoky City' became ˜America's Most Livable City.'" I studied a related thematic panel display about our region's air. Of course, I thought it would have comparisons of Pittsburgh's air quality past and present, maybe some data about toxic industrial pollution that plagues our region, perhaps a mention of the controversial S ***  ethane cracker plant in Beaver? I doubted it would mention the 6,700 air pollution violations by U.S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works in three and a half years, but you never know. This was a conference of environmental journalists, after all.
But no, none of it was mentioned.
One point of redemption was an environmental justice panel on the conference's opening night. The panel included Braddock Mayor John Fetterman who reminded us: œYour zip code determines your destiny, while referring to his city as a œzone of sacrifice. In addition, one of nine associated field tours “ on the sidelines of the conference “ focused on the cracker plant and fracking.
But given all the ongoing fossil fuel development and investment, it seems our entire region is becoming a zone of sacrifice. We need to acknowledge this reality in order to have any chance of transforming it.
ass
The Climate Reality training featured speakers from near and far who discussed fracking, environmental justice and more, while Gore's famous slideshow covered multiple topics. In the course of the trainings, I even learned that Pennsylvania's Constitution guarantees its citizens clean air and pure water. But the most impactful and frightening presentation I attended was Fossil Fuel Development and Your Health, a breakout session two floors away from the main hall, featuring local pediatrician Dr. Ned Ketyer and Raina Rippel, director of Southwest Pennsylvania Environmental Health Project. The session was packed. We filmed it, and I'm glad we did.
Both cancer survivors, Dr. Ketyer and Rippel painted a compelling and grim picture of the fossil fuel industry's effects on human health. Their focus was Allegheny County and Southwestern Pennsylvania. Dr. Ketyer warned that the new S ***  plant poses a œclear and present danger that these are œthreatening times. He echoed Fetterman's warning that your zip code is among the most important œsocial determinants of health. Where did you grow up? Where do you live now? What toxic exposures have you and other family members experienced in the past and present?
Dr. Ketyer reiterated that the Pittsburgh region has some of the worst air quality in the country, the third worst air of all U.S. metro regions for two serious health hazards: fine particulate matter and smog. We have double the normal rate of childhood asthma, and significantly increased risks of other respiratory issues and cancers.
How can we feel good about living, working, playing, rearing kids, growing older in a place with air that substantially increases our risks for cancer and other ailments?
Rippel warned of the correlation between fracking and cancer, reminding us that the S ***  plant will rely on natural gas and that the facility will œlock our region into exponentially increased fracking. She also emphasized that the S ***  plant's purpose is to produce plastic. Tying it all together, Rippel said, œEthane is the prize of Marcellus shale and also the feedstock for plastic. She urged the audience to decrease plastic consumption, to help lower the demand for it. With recent reports that by 2050 there could be more plastic than fish in the sea, there's no good argument for producing more plastic. Many places now ban plastic bags and disposable plastic. Why would our region tie its future to producing more of what is being banned elsewhere?
I left the session depressed, angry and mystified. The mood in the main hall felt like a pep rally for Pittsburgh's sustainability, with Mayor Bill Peduto heralding the city's green initiatives and buildings, the city's climate action plan, etc. All of this is true and worth celebrating. However, we cannot honestly nor ethically call our city sustainable when the mere act of living here is a health hazard.
In a mock town hall meeting, Mayor Peduto fielded questions to help prepare trainees for similar scenarios. One of my local eco-sheroes planetary scientist Maren Cooke spoke up
Thank you for reminding your fellow policymakers, polluters and the world at large of the public health price that this region has already paid[But] what can the city do to prevent the creation of a petrochemical hub in our region, which will blow our carbon goals out of the water and bring us to a new era of poisonous air   this time with [volatile organic compounds] instead of soot   cost billions of dollars in tax abatements for only 600 permanent jobs and drive people and businesses away?
The mayor's response? Citizens can and should pressure Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, because the city has no control over the situation. As factual as that may be regarding the new S ***  plant's jurisdiction, many locals in the room deemed the response inadequate. I recently heard a city employee say Mayor Peduto can and should do more. Can't the city sue the county?
Oddly enough, the first morning of the climate training was a Tuesday, the day my family has become accustomed to the stench of emissions from Clairton Works. Shut the doors and windows; keep the dog inside; turn on the air filters, as we grab our phones to file reports on the Smell PGH app. It is a strange and familiar routine.
Filmmaker and activist Mark Dixon is always the first to post about the emissions: œStinkburgh Alert! Awful smell this morning. A tireless advocate, he is even in the process of shooting a documentary film, Inversion: The Unfinished Business of Pittsburgh's Air, and is co-founder of NoPetroPa, a grassroots organization dedicated to stopping fracking and the S ***  plant. œNo fracking, no cracking! It's a great slogan. But I fear these descriptions of our air   stinky, smelly   even the name of the app, can lull us into thinking the emissions aren't as dangerous as they are. What if we called it as it is? Maybe PollutionPGH?
How can we feel good about living, working, playing, rearing kids, growing older in a place with air that substantially increases our risks for cancer and other ailments?
The city's laudable climate goals of lowering greenhouse gases will be completely negated by the cracker plant's emissions. And that's just the first plant of its kind; more are in the works. As Dixon puts it, œOur region cannot support a petrochemical industry expansion if we expect to realize our climate goals. Nor can we attract businesses and professionals savvy enough to sniff out the truth. Bakery Square's Google building seems to have figured out one way around the dilemma. A key sales pitch is that its building has the best indoor air quality filtration in the city.
ass
The third big event was the conference at Carnegie Museum featuring the opening keynote by Helmuth Trischler, director of the Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society in Munich. But before he spoke, County Executive Fitzgerald gave an official welcome. He said nothing about our environment, much less our region's human-made pollution. I would have asked a question, but he quickly left after his opening remarks.
Carnegie Museum's exhibit We Are Nature: Living in the Anthropocene is a thought-provoking, emotional look at humanity's impact on Earth's ecosystems. On display until September 2018, it's a must“see. However, when I visited on opening day, the exhibit had no mention of our regional pollution, and inherent climate and health issues. When I asked about that, a museum educator acknowledged it was an oversight, sharing that they are collaborating with local artists and educators to create activities during the duration of the exhibit.
That's a relief, because it can sometimes feel like we're living in the Twilight Zone when all these terrific opportunities to shine light on our environmental issues and brainstorm solutions end up being downplayed or ignored altogether.
When people ask where I live, I tell them about Pittsburgh's great cultural scene, its three rivers. Reluctantly, I share about our region's existing air pollution, which many people don't want to acknowledge.
Ironically, there is a group that gathers occasionally for œTwilight Zone Lunches. The name stems from the feelings of people who moved to Pittsburgh in part due to PR about this being the country's Most Livable City only to realize after relocating that our air is among the nation's worst. With mixed emotions, a few friends are considering leaving in search of a place with better air quality. My family is considering moving, too.
I've traveled to many U.S. cities these past two years with my latest film, Yemanja: Wisdom from the African Heart of Brazil. From L.A. to New York, Washington, D.C., to Montreal, Miami, Atlanta and Denver, people everywhere are talking about climate change, how the weather is different than in years and decades past. Innovative and inspiring solutions are emerging. But none of these other places is banking heavily on industry that will exacerbate environmental problems.
When people ask where I live, I tell them about Pittsburgh's great cultural scene, its three rivers. Reluctantly, I share about our region's existing air pollution, which many people don't want to acknowledge.
My film's narrator, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Alice Walker is often quoted as saying, "Activism is my rent for living on the planet." I agree, as do an increasing number of people in our region. When Walker was in Pittsburgh in 2016, she spoke of being constantly in awe of the beauty of the natural world, and how she can't understand people who don't feel obliged to care for the environment. Most people I know appreciate nature and truly value clean air and water (for themselves, their families, generations to come). But at the same time, most of us in the Pittsburgh region are downwind or around the bend from a seriously polluting industry, plant, well site, etc., putting our health and wellbeing at risk. We deserve better. Our region deserves better.
Unfortunately, we can't always count on public officials and corporations to be transparent, so it's up to us to be vigilant, to be critical consumers of information, to be aware of who's funding research, news, even conferences. At the end of the day, we have to be willing to advocate for what we believe in, and remember that while green is the color of sustainability, it's also the color of money. You can't make something sustainable just by painting it green.
James Francis Gunn Jr.[2] (born August 5, 1966) is an American filmmaker, actor, novelist, and musician. He started his career as a screenwriter in the mid-1990s, writing the scripts for Tromeo and Juliet (1996), The Specials (2000), Scooby-Doo (2002) and its sequel, Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed (2004), and the 2004 version of Dawn of the Dead. He then started working as a director, starting with the horror-comedy film Slither (2006). He subsequently wrote and directed the web series James Gunn's PG *** (2008“2009), the superhero film Super (2010), and the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and its sequel, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017).
Early life
Gunn was born in St. Louis, Missouri. He was raised between St. Louis and Manchester, Missouri.[3][4] His brothers are actor Sean, actor and political writer Matt, screenwriter Brian,[5] and former Executive Vice President with Artisan Entertainment Patrick.[6] He also has a sister named Beth.[7] Their parents are Leota[8] and James F. Gunn, an attorney.[9] Gunn states his surname is derived from the Irish name MacGilGunn, meaning "sons to the servants of the god of the dead".[10]
Growing up, Gunn was influenced by low-budget films such as Night of the Living Dead and Friday the 13th. He read magazines like Fangoria and attended genre movie screenings, including the original Dawn of the Dead at the Tivoli Theatre in St. Louis. At the age of 12, he began making 8 mm zombie films with his brothers in the woods near their home.[11]
Gunn and his brothers all attended the Jesuit St. Louis University High School, where he graduated in 1984.[12][9] He went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts from Saint Louis University.[13] While at Saint Louis University, Gunn created political cartoons for the school's student weekly, The University News.[14] Gunn said that, at an unspecified time in his college education, "I went to two years undergraduate film school at Loyola Marymount in Los Angeles. But I was pretty screwed up at the time, and had to leave. Years later I went to graduate school at the Columbia University School of Fine Arts but I studied prose writing, not film writing."[15] He earned a Master of Fine Arts from Columbia University in 1995.[16]
Career
Music
While living in St. Louis, Gunn started a band, The Icons, in 1989, serving as lead vocalist. The group released the album Mom, We Like It Here on Earth in 1994, and its songs "Sunday" and "Walking  *** *" were featured in the film Tromeo and Juliet. The Icons disbanded in the mid-1990s.[17] Gunn has continued to work in music, composing songs for Scooby-Doo, Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed, and Movie 43.
Film and television
Gunn began his career in filmmaking with Troma Entertainment in 1995, for which he wrote the independent film Tromeo and Juliet. Working alongside his mentor Lloyd Kaufman, the co-founder of Troma, Gunn learned how to write screenplays, produce films, scout locations, direct actors, distribute films, and create his own poster art.[11] After contributing to several other Troma films, Gunn in 2000 wrote, produced and performed in the superhero comedy The Specials, directed by Craig Mazin and featuring Rob Lowe, Thomas Haden Church, Paget Brewster, Judy Greer and Jamie Kennedy.
Gunn's first major Hollywood screenplay was Scooby-Doo in 2002. In 2004, he wrote the screenplays for the remake of Dawn of the Dead and the sequel Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed. With these films, Gunn became the first screenwriter to have two films top the box office in consecutive weeks.[18] That same year, he executive produced and starred in the mockumentary LolliLove, directed by and starring his then-wife Jenna Fischer. His film directorial debut was the 2006 horror-comedy Slither, which was included on Rotten Tomatoes' list of the 50 Best Ever Reviewed Horror Movies.[19]
Gunn's next projects included the comedy short film "Humanzee!" which was originally intended exclusively for the Xbox Live's Horror Meets Comedy series of short comedy films by horror directors, it was replaced with "Sparky and Mikaela" which debuted on Xbox Live on December 31, 2008. In an April 2009 interview on The Jace Hall Show, Gunn described "Sparky and Mikaela" as being "about a human [and] racoon crime fighting team and they fight crime in both the forest world, among the furry animals, and in the human world".[20] Gunn also has a short-form web series for Spike.com titled James Gunn's PG ass.
In 2008, Gunn was a judge on the VH1 reality television show, Scream Queens where 10 unknown actresses compete for a role in the film Saw VI, where he directed contestants during acting challenges.[21]
In 2009, Gunn announced he was going to write and direct Pets, a comedy about a man who is abducted by aliens who want to turn him into a household pet, with Ben Stiller, Stuart Cornfeld and Jeremy Kramer producing.[22] However, by March 2009, Gunn announced, "Pets unfortunately, is done. I'm gone. I left the project for various reasons. I hope it sees the light of day somehow, but it won't be with me attached as director."[23]
In 2010, Gunn released Super, a dark comedy and superhero satire starring Rainn Wilson and Ellen Page. Gunn co-wrote and directed the Marvel Studios adaptation of Guardians of the Galaxy, which was released on August 1, 2014.[24] His brother, Sean, has a role in the film. Gunn has appeared as an actor, mostly in smaller roles or uncredited appearances in his own projects. Dan Gilroy and Jack Black separately lamented the proliferation of superhero films,[25] Gunn responded in a Facebook post, saying in part
[P]opular fare in any medium has always been snubbed by the self-appointed elite. ... What bothers me slightly is that many people assume because you make big films that you put less love, care, and thought into them then people do who make independent films or who make what are considered more serious Hollywood films. ... If you think people who make superhero movies are dumb, come out and say we're dumb. But if you, as an independent filmmaker or a 'serious' filmmaker, think you put more love into your characters than the Russo Brothers do Captain America, or Joss Whedon does the Hulk, or I do a talking raccoon, you are simply mistaken.[26]
Gunn wrote and produced the horror film The Belko Experiment, which was released in 2017.[27] In 2016, he directed three Stan Lee cameo scenes in one day, for the film Doctor Strange and two unrevealed projects.[28][29][30]
Gunn wrote and directed Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017).[31][32][33] Gunn was slated to direct Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, but in July 2018, Disney removed Gunn as the director amid controversy over off-color jokes he had tweeted.[34]
In October 2018, Gunn was hired to write a completely new script for Suicide Squad 2, with the intention of also serving as director, after its original director Gavin O'Connor left due to scheduling issues.[35][36]
Other media
Gunn wrote a novel in 2000, The Toy Collector, a story of a hospital orderly who steals drugs from the hospital which he sells to help keep his toy collection habit alive. In 1998, he and Troma's President Lloyd Kaufman co-wrote All I Need to Know about Filmmaking I Learned from the Toxic Avenger, about his experiences with Kaufman while working at Troma. He wrote the story for Grasshopper Manufacture's video game Lollipop Chainsaw.[37]
Firing from Disney
In July 2018, alt-right conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich drew attention to tweets that Gunn wrote between 2008 and 2012, joking about topics like rape, child abuse, and *********ia.[38]
Amid criticism of the tweets, Disney severed ties with Gunn. He was fired as director of the upcoming Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 film;[39] he was also dismissed from a role to help lead Marvel's planned "Cosmic Universe".[40] Gunn responded: "I have regretted [those jokes] for many years since. [...] Regardless of how much time has passed, I understand and accept the business decisions taken today. Even these many years later, I take full responsibility for the way I conducted myself then. All I can do now [is offer] my sincere and heartfelt regret [...] To everyone inside my industry and beyond, I again offer my deepest apologies."[39][41]
Disney's decision received criticism from several entertainers and journalists, including actors Dave Bautista, Selma Blair, Patton Oswalt, David Dastmalchian, Michael Ian Black, Mikaela Hoover, Mike Colter, Alex Winter, David Hasselhoff, directors Joe Carnahan and Fede Alvarez, comics artist Jim Starlin, musician Rhett Miller, comedian Jim Jefferies, Rick and Morty creator Justin Roiland, journalist David A. French, and Troma Entertainment founder and president Lloyd Kaufman.[42][43][44] Bobcat Goldthwait, who worked as a voice actor on the 1997 Disney film Hercules, responded to the incident by asking Disney to remove his voice from an upcoming park attraction based on the film.[45]
A number of media outlets openly criticized Disney's decision, including Collider, Cartoon Brew, The Daily Dot, The Independent, National Review, MovieWeb, and Vulture.[38][43][46] An online petition urging Disney to re-hire Gunn received over 400,000 signatures.[42][47]
On July 30, 2018, Guardians of the Galaxy cast members Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Sean Gunn, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, and Michael Rooker released a joint statement through social media expressing their support for Gunn.[48]
Because of this, Sony Pictures decided to not promote Gunn's upcoming horror film Brightburn at the 2018 San Diego Comic Con.[49]
Personal life
Gunn married actress Jenna Fischer on October 7, 2000, in an event that Gunn's hometown paper said was officiated by Lloyd Kaufman,[9] but which Gunn later clarified had not been: "They said I was married by Lloyd Kaufman, which is not true. He was at my wedding and he gave a speech."[30] Gunn and Fischer had originally met in the St. Louis area through Gunn's brother Sean, who had acted in plays alongside Fischer in high school.[11] After seven years of marriage, Gunn and Fischer announced their separation in a joint statement on September 5, 2007,[50] divorcing in 2008.[51] In 2010, Fischer persuaded Gunn to cast Rainn Wilson, her co-star on The Office, in Gunn's film Super.[11]
Gunn has been in a relationship with actress Jennifer Holland since 2015.[52]
Gunn was raised in a Roman Catholic family and has mentioned how prayer continues to play an important role in his life,[53] but has also said that he is "in some ways, anti-religion".[54] Gunn explained his views in detail in 2016
My personal take is that there is a role for spirituality in some people's lives and I think that a belief in God can be a good thing for a great amount of people [...] I do not like any sort of faith or religion that is based on exclusivity, meaning any sort of religion that says you're  *** ed to  ***  or you're not going to be saved because you don't believe the same thing I do. I believe faith and spiritual belief is a very, very personal thing and if I started applying what I believe to everybody else it would be unfair to everybody's individuality and I really hate that.[55]

Late Wednesday, the Mobile Transporter rail car on the station's truss was being moved by robotic flight controllers at Mission Control, Houston, to a different worksite near the center of the truss for payload operations when it stopped moving. The cause of the stall is being evaluated, but experts believe it may be related to a stuck brake handle, said ISS Mission Integration and Operations Manager Kenny Todd. Flight controllers had planned to move the transporter away from the center of the truss to worksite 2. The cause of the stall that halted its movement just four inches (10 centimeters) away from where it began is still being evaluated. Progress 62 is scheduled to launch at 3:44 a.m. EST Monday, and dock on Wednesday to the Pirs docking compartment at 5:31 a.m. Wednesday.
The ISS Mission Management Team met Friday morning and is targeting Monday for the spacewalk, but will meet again in a readiness review Sunday morning. Managers could elect to press ahead for Monday, or take an extra day and conduct the spacewalk Tuesday.
ISS Expedition 46 Commander Scott Kelly and Flight Engineer Tim Kopra of NASA will conduct the spacewalk. It will be the 191st spacewalk in support of space station assembly and maintenance, the third in Kelly's career and the second for Kopra. Kelly will be designated Extravehicular Activity crew member 1 (EV1) wearing the suit bearing the red stripes, and Kopra will be Extravehicular Activity crew member 2 (EV2) wearing the suit with no stripes.
Daniel Craig will reportedly return to the iconic role of James Bond after signing up to play the super-spy in two more films.
According to The Sun, Craig has reached a deal with producer Barbara Broccoli which will see him return for Bond 25, which is set for release next year, along with a final outing in the iconic role.
And while the plot for Bond 25 is yet to be revealed, the report claims that Craig's final Bond film could be a remake of 1969's On Her Majesty's Secret Service.
A source said: œThere was plenty of talk about who would be the next Bond but Barbara has managed to talk Daniel into two more films. He is loved by audiences around the world and has driven a real resurgence for the movies at the box office, so bosses knew they couldn't lose him just yet.
œThe script is nearly ready for the 25th film, provisionally titled Shatterhand and scheduled to be released in November 2019, so there is no time to waste on getting Daniel locked in. But the deal is almost done and the idea of returning to On Her Majesty's Secret Service for the 26th movie is really exciting. The film sees James get married, only for his wife to be killed, so it would be an explosive way to end his reign as 007.
Bend, OR   On Tuesday, a torrent of new information on the Lavoy Finicum shooting, including a photo of where he was shot and video from the inside of his vehicle during the road block, were released to the public.
Since the shooting, which was captured on video from the FBI's birdseye view, there have been many theories surrounding the death of Finicum.
According to the official story, Lavoy Finicum was killed by officers because they had no other choice as he was reaching for a gun in his left pocket. Officials claim they later found a loaded 9 mm semi-automatic handgun in that pocket.
[ads1]
It is evident from the video that Finicum never presented the handgun. However, we can clearly see him reaching for his left side.
In a photo of the autopsy report, taken by RT's Simone Del Rosario at the press conference on Tuesday, and the newly released video, there is a now an alternative reason, outside of going for a gun, as to why Finicum was reaching toward his left side   he was shot there.
The newly released video shows that officers and agents opened fire on the vehicle prior to Finicum exiting it.
The people in the SUV were pinned down and being painted by laser sights, so they couldn't leave the vehicle   yet the agents kept pumping tear gas rounds into it. Did they want to flush them out, and gun them down? Would anything else make sense?
The dramatic scene unfolded as Finicum exited the truck and repeatedly told officers to œshoot me. At approximately 5:36 in the video, it appears that Finicum could have been shot.
Here's the autopsy report showing the three shots in Finicum #OregonStandoff pic.twitter.com/CQn7COKzkL   Simone Del Rosario (@SimoneReports) March 8, 2016
Seemingly, Finicum's intentions were to draw fire away from the truck   and that is exactly what he did. This cost him his life.
The last scene in the video shows a terrified little girl, Victoria Sharp, the 18-year-old gospel singer emerging from the SUV, her hands upraised, and her body painted by laser sights. One targeted her head, the other the center of her chest. On Tuesday, the state troopers involved in the killing of Lavoy Finicum were found justified in their actions.
œAll six shots fired by the Oregon State Police, the three into the truck and the three that struck Mr. Finicum, are justified, said Malheur County District Attorney Dan Norris in a prepared statement. He said the shots were œin fact, necessary.
œMr. Finicum repeatedly and knowingly made choices that put him in this situation, Harney County District Attorney Tim Colahan said in a prepared statement. œIt was not the outcome that any of us wanted but one he, alone, is responsible for.
Although Norris announced that the shots were justified, a shroud of conspiracy and misconduct remains. After announcing that the state troopers committed no wrongdoing, it was announced that multiple FBI agents are under investigation who were on the scene that day.
Authorities revealed that at least one FBI agent is suspected of lying about firing twice at Robert œLaVoy Finicium, and may have gotten help from four other FBI agents in covering it up afterward.
A lot of work goes into these malformed images, so I asked why Hunt just discards them in the street. He said he feels they're not given away but earned. More importantly, he told me that there are really two cities in this sprawling desert metropolis, one visible and one hidden. Stashing his works is what makes him feel a part of the underground.
There's what you see on the evening news all the over-hyped art events funded by downtown arts commissions, occasionally throwing artists a bone by convincing them to build hideous sculptures for the light-rail station and "then, Hunt told me, œthere's the secret Phoenix.
œThis is the Phoenix built by artists and musicians who've been burned by our city enough times to know that no good can come of the 'progress' the city council has in store for us, he continued. œWe watched as they turned Mill Avenue which was once the closest thing we had to a cultural jewel into a nightmarish coagulation of chain restaurants and douchebag bars. We stood by as they forced us out of our legitimately affordable Tempe homes with the intention of tearing them down in favor of ˜modern, affordable loft spaces for the metropolitan artist' that no local artist we knew of could afford. This was part of the reason we all began fleeing Tempe for Phoenix, and now it's beginning to happen [again].
Hunt, who refused to be photographed, has never let anyone join him when hiding his art, but eventually he relented and let me tag along for one of his latest searches, 23 Birds for Tempe. The œshow fell on February 23, a date that holds mystical meaning for the artist. Birds are also a strange choice for Hunt, as he told me in no uncertain terms that he œ *** ing hates them. But he does like watching them. œThey're apocalyptic, he said as we cruised down Apache Boulevard. œWhenever a bird shows up in the Bible or any holy document, it's not a good sign. Unless they're feeding Elijah, which is  *** ing insane, it's not a good sign. I like that.
One of Hunt's biggest projects from last year was the Ova Concilium Scroll, a bunch of sketches and drawings that he taped, stapled, and glued together until it reached almost 95 feet. It wouldn't even fit in a gallery if he tried, so instead he dismantled it and hid the artwork. Hunt also likes to scavenge, going out to the desert to collect things like rocks, rusty metal objects, and the bones of small animals.
œThere's something about a found object that means more to me than something you buy. It feels earned, Hunt explained. œI like the idea of somebody coming across a painting during an evening walk. I also like that it may never be found. Secret, hidden worlds are much more interesting to me than the ones that are out in the open for all to see There's nothing quite like watching swarms of people turn over rocks and stick their heads down storm drains in hopes of finding something I made. It means more to me than if somebody were to just stare uninterested at one of my paintings on a wall for five minutes and move on to the next one. With the art hunts, the people participating become a part of the project.
Because Hunt doesn't have a driver's license, for œmoral reasons, he rides his bike everywhere. This is how he discovers these hidden worlds, and as we cruised around Tempe squirreling away paintings, he pointed out the many bizarre, unmapped landmarks he's all too familiar with.
We stopped behind a paramilitary complex not far from the train tracks complete with camo netting, barbed wire, and old military ambulances. While Hunt buried a painting in the tall grass, a homeless dude stopped to talk to himself and stare at the structure before wandering away.
Later, Hunt helped me find an area of Phoenix just off of 32nd Street and Thomas Avenue where wild pea *** s, guinea hens, and chickens have roamed free for decades after a nearby farm was flattened into suburbs. Some neighbors wanted the birds gone, but the city told the suburbanites to go  ***  themselves the birds were there first.
It's scenes like this that make up the "secret Phoenix" Hunt would rather be a part of. Altogether, Hunt and I hid 23 watercolors, small canvases, and medium-size boards in bushes, on backstreets, and beside train tracks. A few hours after Hunt posted clues online to the paintings' whereabouts, about 300 people would go out on a scavenger hunt.
But not everyone is a fan of Hunt and what he does. For the last seven years, the painter has had a kind of nemesis, an elusive man named David Syndrome, who apparently seeks out Hunt's work so he can throw it away. I spoke to David via email, and he insisted on referring to himself in the third person, describing his anti-art campaign as œa spiritual and aesthetic crusade against the psychic tyranny of the man-made image controlled by society's elite.
œJames B. Hunt is one cog in a gigantic mechanism of control David Syndrome wishes to free mankind from, he said in the email. œThe images Mr. Hunt and other agents distribute aren't destroyed as much as they are cleansed. Remains are kept until they have been deemed innocuous and no possibility of the cabal's influence can hurt the general population. It's important that civic-minded people take action in a totalitarian regime to reclaim our reality for future generations. I implore any and all people working on the side of goodness to do what needs to be done.
David Syndrome is a kind of symbol of the darker side of the secret Phoenix, but even that opposing force won't stop Hunt from doing all he can to hold onto what's left of the city's eccentric soul. I was left with his stinging refrain: "There's a lesson we keep learning, which is that if you're an artist, this city is not your friend."
Of course, I'm glad to have the opportunity to do this the right way. So without further ado, for your convenience, below is an image of each commander legal in Tiny Leaders, sorted by color identity. Please let me know if you notice anything wrong and I will update the post.

Ingredients
1 lb ground turkey
3 tsp minced garlic
2 cups tomato sauce (I recommend using either a homemade sauce or a No Sugar Added sauce)
1 tsp Mrs. Dash Italian seasoning
1 (8oz) bag of shredded, reduced fat mozzarella cheese
1 large spaghetti squash
1/2 cup Feta cheese
Method
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
2. Brown the ground turkey over medium heat and then drain off the fat. Add in the garlic, tomato sauce, Mrs. Dash seasoning, and 1/2 the bag of shredded mozzarella.
3. Cut the stem off the spaghetti squash, and then cut in half lengthwise. Scoop out the seeds from the squash and either discard them or save them for roasting. Place a squash half face down on a plate and cover with saran wrap, tucking the plastic wrap under the sides of the plate. Microwave for 10 minutes, then do the same with the other half. Remove the plastic wrap carefully (lots of steam will escape when you remove it). Then, using a fork, scrape out the insides of the squash halves into a 9Ã—13 pan that has been sprayed with non-stick spray.
The squash œnoodles form the bottom layer of the casserole.
4. Spoon the meat and cheese mixture on top of the squash and even that layer out.
5. Sprinkle the feta cheese and the rest of the mozzarella cheese on top and bake uncovered for about 20-25 minutes.
6. Then, broil for 3-5 minutes (500 degrees) until the cheese is nice and browned on top.
This was very, very good. It filled the house with that great, savory smell of basil, oregano, and tomatoes. And of course, Luna was right beside the whole time just begging for a taste. She's such a good sous chef ðŸ˜‰
I've been enjoying the leftovers all week for lunch ðŸ™‚
If you want to roast the squash seeds, have a look at the very simple instructions included in this post on Baked Acorn Squash.
The macros for this recipe are as follows, if you divide the 9Ã—13 pan into 8 servings
Kcal = 200
CHO = 9 grams
FAT = 9 grams
PRO = 21 grams
So what do you think? Have you ever had spaghetti squash before?
Think you'll give it a try?

Cravaughn Lacrae Maloy, 21, was convicted Tuesday by a Jefferson County jury of pimping of a child, patronizing a prostituted child, keeping a place of child prostitution inducement of child prostitution. A co-defendant, Alicia Sykes, 22, was also arrested and charged with the same counts as Maloy.
Maloy told the girl, who had recently run away from a youth home, that she would have to become a prostitute if she wanted to stay with him, according to the affidavit provided by the Jefferson County District Attorney's Office. It also says, at one point, he threatened to punch her "if she did not stand on the corner and make money."
The affidavit says Sykes took photos of the teen in lingerie at a motel and then posted them as part of an escort ad on the website Backpage.com.
The teen said she had *** with at least a dozen men while staying at the couple's home between June 23 and July 1 of 2014.
Now they can move forward and put out a new record. They may not have the Kyuss moniker, but it seems pretty safe to assume whatever these dudes put their minds and hearts into is going to wind up with that desert spirit. Here's the news
Former KYUSS Members John Garcia, Brant Bjork and Nick Oliveri Announce New Band: VISTA CHINO
Legendary Rock Musicians Announce Final Live Performances as œKYUSS LIVES!; Detail Major Plans with Exciting New Project
Brant Bjork, John Garcia and Nick Oliveri   formerly of KYUSS   are pleased to introduce their new project: VISTA CHINO. The group, comprised of the three founding members of the legendary rock band and guitarist Bruno Fevery, are currently recording new material in anticipation of a 2013 worldwide release that will coincide with major touring plans.
The author's approach is two-fold. By presenting and criticizing arguments that have been advanced in favor of belief, he makes a case for "negative atheism." By offering arguments against atheism and defending it from these attacks, he presents a case for "positive atheism." Along the way, he confronts the views of numerous philosophers among them Anselm, Aquinas, Plantinga, Hick, and Swinburne and refutes both classical and contemporary arguments that have been advanced through the history of this debate.
Devour Downtown offers rare public dining access to members-only places like the Columbia Club and the Skyline Club.
Those two businesses are among 85 total that include savings of up to 30 percent off lunch and dinner prices.
Devour Downtown continues its 11-year tradition of offering a bargain to people who otherwise might not be tempted to come to the heart of Indianapolis.
Devour Downtown was much different a decade ago, with not as many residents living in the city's core.
Restaurants started noticing that business was dipping toward the end of every January, long after the holiday celebrations ended.
Noticing similarly successful events in other cities, 21 different Indianapolis restaurants got together with an advisory board to create Devour Downtown in 2005. They expanded to include a summer sale.
Businesses say it offers great exposure and allows people to sample the menu, service, and experience.
As the event grows, it's not just limited to restaurants.
The NCAA Hall of Champions is offering buy-one-get-one free admission. The Conrad has a deal on hotel rooms for $149.
While 2016 will be the last Devour Downtown, the deals and promotions at those businesses will continue.
In 2017, several popular œrestaurant weeks are merging into one event, simply called Devour Indy.
The new Devour Indy will include old favorites like Chow Down Midtown, Devour Downtown, and Northside Nights all rolled into one, two-week event starting in Jan. 2017 and continuing with another run in the summer.
Savor the Southside hasn't been held in a few years, but interested restaurants will be part of the new event.
Details are still being finalized for Devour Indy.
* Men reported killed after surrendering to Shi'ite militia
* Provincial authorities say surviving detainees tortured
* U.S.-led coalition says perpetrators should be punished
By Maher Chmaytelli and Ahmed Rasheed
BAGHDAD, June 13 (Reuters) - Iraq is investigating allegations that Shi'ite militiamen helping the army retake Falluja have executed dozens of Sunni Muslim men from the city held by Islamic State.
The authorities "are following up on the violations and a number of arrests have been made," government spokesman Saad al-Hadithi said on Monday after a regional governor said 49 Sunni men had been executed after surrendering to a Shi'ite faction.
Suhaib al-Rawi, governor of Anbar province where Falluja is located, said on Sunday that 643 men had gone missing between June 3 and June 5, and "all the surviving detainees were subjected to severe and collective torture by various means."
The participation of militias in the battle of Falluja, just west of Baghdad, alongside the Iraqi army had already raised fears of sectarian killings.
Falluja is a historic bastion of the Sunni insurgency against U.S. forces that toppled Saddam Hussein, a Sunni, in 2003, and the Shi'ite-led governments that followed.
"Strict orders were issued to protect the civilians," government spokesman Hadithi said, adding that these instructions were also given to the Hashid Shaabi, or Popular Mobilisation Forces, the coalition of mostly Shi'ite militias backed by Iran which are involved in the fighting.
The United Nations said last week it knew of "extremely distressing, credible reports" of men and boys being abused by armed groups working with security forces after fleeing Falluja.
Iraqi authorities routinely separate males aged over 15 from their families when they manage to escape Falluja, to screen them to ensure they do not pose a security risk and check if they may have been involved in war crimes.
U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein said that screening was legitimate but should not be done by paramilitary groups.
Civilians from Falluja had suffered "two and a half years of living  *** " under Islamic State and faced not just enormous danger in escaping but also "double jeopardy in the form of serious human rights violations," Zeid said.
A spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State said the Baghdad government was aware of the abuses.
"We know that the prime minister has come out and said that he believes that these abuses have happened and that he ... has demanded accountability of any perpetrators," Colonel Chris Garver said. "We think that is the right course of action."
The Iraqi army launched the offensive on Falluja on May 23, with air support from the U.S.-led coalition. The United Nations has said up to 90,000 people are trapped in the city with little food or water.
Repeated phone calls to three spokesmen of the Popular Mobilisation Forces were not answered. Last week, one of them, Kareem Nuri, said past accusations of human rights violations were "politically motivated and baseless". (Additional reporting by Stephen Kalin; Editing by Robin Pomeroy)
The house looks somewhat like a series of inflated balloons, which makes sense, as this was how it was constructed. Steel rebar and wire mesh frames were constructed over large inflated balloons and then sprayed with high velocity concrete known as gunite or œshotcrete.
This building technique, known as œmonolithic dome construction was invented by the South brothers in S *** y, Idaho in 1975. One year later, Bay Area architect William Nicholson built a series of domes using this method, including The Flintstone House in Hillsborough, California.
The home, which is also referred to as the Dome House, Gumby House, Worm Casting House and Bubble House, is a three-bedroom, two-bath house with a two-car garage and about 2,700 square feet of living space. The upstairs bedroom, located in the tallest dome, has a spiral staircase inspired by a sugar-cone with a diameter that increases to equal that of the floor above. The master bathroom is also unique with its scattering of large rocks in place of floor tiles.
While The Flintstone House is marveled at by many passerby, it is also loathed by many Hillsborough residents. In the mid-1980s the home began to show serious wear as water runoff on the steep hillside caused the home to sink and the walls began to develop deep cracks. Word spread of such problems and several neighbors pushed to have the home removed. However, to their dismay, a severe renovation and change in ownership brought the home back to life in 1987. It took on its characteristic œFlintstone look when it was painted completely orange in 2000.
Today, The Flintstone House is as well known for its architecture as it is for its sporadic tenants, which has led to several urban legends surrounding the home's ownership. It is rumored that George Lucas once owned the house and that O.J. Simpson made a bid following his infamous 1995 trial. It is also said that several famous Sillicon Valley investors have lived there as well.
Ken, what is going on at US F1 Team?
œIt has been quite a ride since we started the team last year, and has become far more intense since the signing of the Concorde Agreement. Our world headquarters is now complete and fully functional, and the 2010 racecar is in the construction phase.
So the car is finally being built? Isn't it a little late to get something like that started?
œFunny that you ask that question “ we get that one a lot. Thanks to our in-house design and engineering staff and the aid of our technical partners, for the last 10 to 12 months, the car has gone through thousands of iterations in a virtual environment. With this virtual design, we can test and be sure that it's right from structural, design and engineering standpoints, so we don't have to make a part, test it, break it and start again. Instead, we've taken out a lot of the guesswork and can get close to a race-ready piece right off of the machines, which is happening now. Our timing is according to plan, with an early November œroller and a finished car in time for January 2010 testing.
So who's building the car? Americans? Europeans? Are you building the car in Charlotte?
œI'll answer the last part of the question first. Yes, we're building the car in our shop here in Charlotte. America is known as a œmelting pot and our team is a reflection of just that. Americans, Europeans, New Zealanders, Welshmen and more are responsible for the racecar, including many who have high-level experience in the current Formula One environment. Many of our new hires we connected with back in June and July, and they will be joining the team formally at the end of the month. We are very grateful to the current Formula One teams for releasing some of our œnewest team members early “ that has been a huge help as we continue to prepare for the 2010 Formula One season.
Let's talk about what we're seeing in some of these pictureswhat are we looking at here?
œIn two words, we're œfully equipped. Our machine shop features three- and five-axis CNC machines; we have a composite shop with autoclaves and a 24-foot CNC cutting table; a complete fab shop; assembly and sub-assembly; electronics; research and development; design and engineering; CFD and aerodynamics; marketing and communications; and a full in-house HD production facility, just to name a few departments. Building a team and a world class manufacturing facility are a work-in-progress but we're ahead of schedule and are excited about going racing next year.
Can you talk a little about the cost efficiency of manufacturing a Formula One car in the U.S. How can the operation be cheaper than what we've seen out there?
could imagine, this news traveling quickly to capitol hill. Where some Republicans began joining some Democrats calling for this move. Both sides want James Comey on the hill testifying before the American people about what he wrote about his meetings with the president. ABC's Mary Bruce tonight on the hill. Reporter: With his white house consumed by crises, president trump today venting to the coast guard graduation class. Look at the way I've been treated lately. Especially by the media. No politician in history -- and I say this with great assurety -- has been treated worse or more unfairly. Reporter: Back in Washington, even members of the president's own party say we may be at a tipping point. I think it's reaching the point where it's of watergate size and scale. Reporter: The latest allegations rippling through the Republican party. That news the president may have asked then-fbi director James Comey to shut down his investigation into fired national security adviser Michael Flynn. Do you want Comey to testify? I want facts! Reporter: Both parties are clamoring for Comey to testify. Mitch Mcconnell telling the wall Street journal -- I think we need to hear for him as soon as possible in public and leaders of three congressional committees say they want to see the moment know Comey wrote, documenting his conversations with the president. On the surface that seems like an extraordinary use of influence to try to shut down an investigation being done by the FBI. Do you want Comey to testify? On the hill, a doesy day of dodges. Republicans can't be okay with this. Reporter: Tonight, one Republican congressman Justin Amash reportedly saying if the allegations in the Comey memo are true it could be an impeachable offense. Mr. Speaker do you still have full confidence in the president? I do. Reporter: 118 days into the new administration, Republicans had hoped to be plowing ahead with their agenda, health care, tax reform, deregulation. Instead they're careening from crisis to crisis. On the campaign trail, trump warned this would happen under a Hillary Clinton's presidency. If Hillary Clinton is elected she'll be understo investigation. The investigation will last for years. To nothing will get done. That was the prediction had Hillary Clinton been elected. Mary Bruce on capitol hill tonight. We could see former FBI director James Comey testifying next week. Reporter: The house oversight wants the former FBI director to testify at a hearing here next Wednesday. The senate intelligence committee is also eager to hear from Comey. The top Democrat on that committee telling me he's as confident as Nick he'll be tefl soon. I want to bring in Dan Abrams, we heard from Pierre Thomas off the top there. He said Mr. Mueller can step in here and months after this FBI investigation, even before the election and he could start over. That's what an independent counsel means, it means he can now decide what he wants to do with all that information. I think it's really important that he bring in some of his own people. He doesn't want to be seen as just using the FBI people who are already there. Expect him to put together his own team to draw his own conclusion. Meantime you heard from lawmakers on the hill. Some are beginning to use the term obstruction of justice. Pointing to the memo that James Comey reportedly wrote. Many legal experts say this memo in and of itself doesn't mean obstruction of justice. The memo itself doesn't. You need the context. Some of the other things that Mueller will be looking at, are the reports, the demand of loyalty at a dinner, the fact that the president admitted that Russia was on his mind when he fired Comey. The fact that he was alone in the white house, asked Jeff sessions and vice president pence to leave the room when he made these comments that were in the memo. Take all of that together and most importantly, with James Comey's account and then you assess -- is this obstruction or is not. A long summer ahead. Dan, as always, thank you. I want to bring in Cecilia Vega tonight. She's set to travel with president trump on his first foreign trip. This white house was hoping this trip help them turn the pe or reset. But the world leaders are watching this, too. They are. They were out doing how well this white house feels the president has been doing with foreign leaders ahead of this visit, especially heading into the Muslim world. This will undoubtedly hang over president trump's head as will that conversation in the oval office where he's accused of giving highly classified intelligence to the Russians.

"I know you never liked me Mr. Secretary-General “ well, I never liked you, either," said Mr Sha as Mr Ban looked on, smiling and nodding awkwardly during the 15-minute toast attended by the UN's top brass.
Mr Sha, who was appointed the UN undersecretary general for Economic and Social Affairs in 2007, also made no secret of his fractious relationship with Mr Ban, although did say he'd grown to respect the South Korean.
"You've been trying to get rid of me," said 62-year-old Mr Sha according to the senior UN official present, "You can fire me anytime, you can fire me today."
Later in his impromptu speech Mr Sha turned to an American colleague, singling out Bob Orr, from the executive office of the secretary-general.
"I really don't like him: he's an American and I really don't like Americans," he said.
A second senior UN official who was at the dinner said: "It went on for about ten or fifteen minutes but it felt like an hour."
Officials present at the dinner suggested that Mr Sha might have been the victim of a misguided attempt at humour.
The next morning Mr Sha requested a meeting with Mr Ban during which he was "deeply apologetic" according to Farhan Haq, the acting deputy UN spokesman.
Mr Farhan said: "Mr Sha told the Secretary General that he realised that the way that he spoke, coming as it did after he had had a few drinks, was inappropriate, as it went too far. He was also aware that his statements had embarrassed and irritated other senior advisers."
It is not the first time that Mr Sha, a career diplomat, has let the mask of diplomacy slip. In a BBC interview in 2006 he was goaded into a furious, shrieking attack on American criticisms of China's rapidly growing defence budget.
"It is much better for [America] to shut up, keep quiet. Are you the number one? Is it true that the US has almost 50 per cent of the world's military budget?"
The Chinese population is five or six times bigger.
The Russian defence ministry has denied reports that one of its submarines got into trouble in the waters off Sweden.
The Swedish military has been searching the sea since Friday, following what the military said was foreign underwater activity.
It has denied looking for a submarine, and said that it was conducting an intelligence operation.
However, a local newspaper said Sweden had intercepted a distress signal in Russian.
Swedish Rear Admiral Anders Grenstad said the military based its judgement on "not only on current observations, but also on many previous ones from this very area... this is an area of interest to foreign powers".
Soviet submarine sightings during the Cold War caused security alerts in Sweden in the 1980s.

Russia's military intervention in Ukraine this year has fuelled suspicion about its intentions towards other neighbouring states, notably in the Baltic.
It has several submarines based in Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave bordered by Poland and Lithuania and facing out to Sweden, as well as a much bigger force near Murmansk on the Kola Peninsula.
Last month, another Swedish newspaper, Expressen, reported an incursion by two Russian SU-24 fighter bombers into national airspace. Sweden scrambled jets to see them off, it said.
A defence ministry spokesman in Moscow told reporters that the Russian navy's submarines and surface ships were "performing tasks... according to plan".
"There has been no irregular situation, let alone emergency situation, involving Russian navy vessels," he said.
Sources told Svenska Dagbladet newspaper that Sweden had begun a search after a radio transmission in Russian was detected on an emergency frequency on Thursday evening.
Encrypted radio traffic from a point in the Stockholm archipelago and Kaliningrad was later also picked up.
Mic *** e leaves he boyfriend in the middle of the night in a hurry unable to handle something tragic that's happened between them. Suddenly her car is stricken from the road and she awakens in a bunker chained to a wall with her injuries bandaged and tended to. Her captor/savior Howard reveals something catastrophic has taken place outside the bunker and the human race save for the two of them and a stowaway named Emmet are all that's left. Over the course of the film we learn the stories of these three people forced to live together and find out someone is not who they appear to be. As the mystery inside the bunker unravels, the present danger outside worsens until the two problems collide for a dramatic and heart pounding end.
This is an experience of terror and tenseness that is upheld through amazing dialogue delivered through superb acting. John Goodman's Howard keeps you guessing his motives throughout as he delivers a performance that is unsettling but keeps you thinking there is a perfect method to his madness. He is as menacing as he is uncomfortably caring at times which confuses the characters within the film as well as the viewer. He is the doomsday prepper that actually faces doomsday and it's such a scary thing to watch as the tasks he performs he does without a second thought because he has planned for them his entire life. Goodman himself has played many a caring father figure role in films and it's a matter of wanting to trust him because of the evidence backing his claims combined with his fatherly demeanor within the film but at the flip of a coin his survival instincts kick in making you question him. Goodman delivers his role like a psychopath and it's brilliant.
Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Mic *** e has possibly the best story arc evolution in my opinion since Nicholas Holt's performance as Nux from Mad Max. You watch her run away from certain problems which inevitably get her into bigger messes but she quickly adapts watching Goodman's character taking the best aspects of him combined with her own instincts and her ingenuity. She notices every little thing and uses them to her advantage of solving the mysteries of the film and once faced with those mysteries she stops running and confronts them head on in brilliant ways utilizing all her skills and everything she has learned. She might be the best female protagonist since Ripley in Alien and should the franchise continue with her she could easily be as legendary.
Dan Trachtenberg directs most of the film almost like a Hitch *** ian thriller. Many of the scenes establishing shots of horror imagery utilize different angles to hide the worst of them while others will linger on them enough to let the musical score build up the terror within the audience members watching it. Bear McCreary, who is the composer on most genre films nowadays, delivers another amazing score that works so perfectly with Trachtenberg's shots.
I believe it's Tuesday, but I had to double check my phone anyway; it's been a whirlwind of a trip. Europe is wonderful in short. Currently, I'm sitting upstairs in an industrial chic loft on the outskirts of the Brussels tourist district. Brussels is incredible “ the streets are narrow and curved with gothic architecture and bright culture.
It's surreal, like an industrial fairy tale.
Everyone keeps asking me about the games. My favorite was when a guy approached me Cloud9 gear, observing my LGD jersey with a single comment

œThat's brave.
œReally? Because that's just ironic, I replied, motioning at his jersey. There was an exchange of coy smiles before we posed for a picture together.
In general, the crowds have been pleasant. I've always enjoyed attending live events “ hard to explain “ in OCE every cast we do is offline, save for the OPL finals; which I didn't attend. In the LPL and International Wild Card you're a caster behind a desk attempting to engineer an experience.
I've only got to cast for an audience once. During the IWC, I got the honor of casting most of the Chief sets. Naturally, because the Chiefs are the domestic team the office would watch upstairs. It was entirely different being able to walk out of the studio and have a group of people directly give feedback to a cast, feeding off their energy and excitement.
So, I don't have much first-hand experience of feeding off the hype of a moment in a crowded stadium as someone steals the Baron. But I can tell you that the casters, the crowd, and the players feel it. I recommend everyone attend at least one live event in the future.
I suspect most are simply reading this to hear my excuses concerning the LPL's disappointing performance however.
Firstly, no excuses: the LPL teams did not play well. Not a single one of them. There's no debating that, and I don't have the patience (or alcohol) to go through each set and underline the play errors. But this disappointing performance does not translate into: The LPL is bad.
Or overhyped.
For the sake of clarity, I've made a fairly simple graphic to explain my mentality

FNC: http://imgur.com/lxJbQJv
LGD: http://imgur.com/pOa4wnJ
C9: http://imgur.com/TkEekIj
CLG: http://imgur.com/FGk9PKE
I chose those four teams to demonstrate the four iterations of this thought process. Now, œTeam Standard is not relative to the other teams in the Tournament. That black line is not the same placement between LGD and FNC “ that black line is only relative to that respective team's performance over the split. So, FNC has a relatively high Standard Performance across their domestic dominance.
At the World's Tournament, Fnatic are playing above that Standard Performance, but when you compare that to C9's graphic it seems to imply that C9 is outperforming FNC, which is false. C9 is vastly outperforming their Split Standard, but I would also argue that their Standard Performance (black line) is much weaker than Fnatic.
Everyone understand?
So, in the case of CLG “ CLG is underperforming from their Split Average, likewise, LGD is vastly underperforming in respective to their Standard.
I think there's little debate on this topic.
The response typically is: a good team shows up when it counts, which also, has very little debate. No one is every going to argue against that.
And the fact that EDG, LGD, and iG underperformed on the international stage will weight against them, but these tournaments are still just that: an underperformance. Much more was expected of them. And much more exists from them.
What was incredible about Cloud9 is that their demonstrated skill ceiling at Worlds, especially Week 1, hadn't been shown since the organizations roster shuffle. There was no way to predict they could achieve those heights because they'd never been seen.
In the case of EDG “ the world saw their Skill ceiling at MSI “ EDG beat every iteration of SKT: Easyhoon, Faker, and Kkoma. If SKT and EDG had played another best of five the very next day, would EDG have won again? I'm not entirely confident on that. Mistakes were made on both sides, but in the words above: in the important moment, EDG showed up and won.
LGD was a single Baron Fight away from showing up at MSI in EDG's place. A single Deft Crit. If you haven't watched LPL, take not only my word “ but the majority of ****ysts on the broadcast “ LGD is not a bad team.
LGD had a terrible performance.
So, why did every single LPL team have a poor performance if the region isn't inherently weaker than the western audience was led to believe? Countless articles in a much more refined setting have already tackled this topic, I always suggest the work of Kelsey Moser who discusses the scrim culture and preparation for the tournament.
Spawn on the ****yst desk also addressed part of his theories on broadcast, identifying that LGD, in three years, have never played a best of one.
Lil Susie had a great interview where she was suspect of the support structure of the LPL teams, that with an abundance of talent available it had to be an internal issue.
I've heard multiple things and have my own theories, but have no liberty to translate speculation into fact. And in the end, it really doesn't matter why they lost (not in this context).
They lost.
The only thing that particularly mattered to me was the idea that this performance was the standard of the attending LPL teams, and in the case of EDG and LGD, that simply isn't true.
As for iG: abandon all hope.
I Kid.
Not really.
I love the LPL. The players, clubs, and flavor of the scene are incredibly fun. It's a joy to cast and watch. I have no doubt that the LPL infrastructure in management, coaching, and support staff needs to change to avoid another international failure of this magnitude.
Time will tell.
But like IEM for GE Tigers:  ***  happens. A lot of  ***  happened. Like Thorin said in his epic esports monologue: why do we watch esports?
For these moments. For the taste of a European Crown. For the shadow of Faker's throne. For the underdogs in Koo that may be able to outsmart their competition. And for the comeback kids and the rookie that might have the performance of his lifetime.
The unbelievable chain of events that might lead to one of the greatest stories in esports history.
Anyway, I've been sitting in a Hostel lobby for far too long. I'm hungry for good food and even better company, so I'll leave this with basic thoughts. But, this is why I love esports “ the fact that I'm about to head into the night and be merry till the early hours of the morning with people that, come this weekend, will stand and scream and love what I do.
Cheers!
Togashi put his Hunter X Hunter shÅnen action manga on hiatus in December of 2008, and the manga will return after a break of more than a year in next year's combined 5th/6th issue of Shueisha 's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine on January 4. Not coincidentally, Viz Media will publish the 26th volume of the manga in North America on January 5.
Takeuchi and Togashi married in 1999, and the couple, nicknamed the "Princess" and "Prince" of the manga world, had a son in 2001. Takeuchi made her manga debut with her Love Call story in 1986. She created Codename wa Sailor V in 1991 before starting her most famous work, the 1992-1997 magical girl manga Sailor Moon .

I started working on the mapofstrange in 2006. It seems like a lifetime ago. I don't know the exact date.
I can't believe how successful it was.
It was just running on some free hosting for the first couple of years, and that was a bad idea. One day someone put it on Digg. And the other people on Digg liked it. A lot. It got onto page 1. Which is usually a good thing. It wasn't. The free hosting couldn't cope with it and it died. The free host put a message on to say they had taken down. Which kind of meant that the front page of Digg became a bunch of people slating the free host, and slating me for using them.
I moved to a VPS host instead, and that went well to begin with. The number of hits went up, and it started to get noticed. It was featured on German TV. I still can't believe that. It's on my CV. Seriously.
I then put a widget onto the site for iGoogle. Which was overly successful. It was getting a few million hits a month. And every hit was hitting the database. I brought down the VPS. In the end I cached it and I haven't looked back. You live, you learn.
Then I had another problem. The number of new submissions had gone through the roof.
I was getting hundreds of new submissions a day. And 99% of them (or more) were crap. It was all "I live here" or "this is Fred's house", or "sdfdsfdafewfrgbbmkomsiunsdunf". I didn't have time to check them all, and I couldn't let those in. So I turned off submissions. That was the beginning of the end. I still have a 6,000 entry backlog of crap entries to go through. I still haven't checked them.
So I've just left the site alone for 5 and a half years. And with that has come the decision to switch the thing off.
ELIZABETH   A former New York Jets football player pleaded guilty today to spreading assassly revealing images of a girlfriend on social media.
Jermaine Cunningham, 26, admitted before Superior Court Judge William Daniel that he posted photos of the woman's inner thigh, groin and buttocks on an Instagram account in December 2014. Cunningham admitted to posting the photoso as part of plea deal in which he will be placed on probation.
Under questioning from his lawyer, Alfred Gellene, Cunningham also admitted that he posted the images without the woman's permission and "tagged" the pictures with the woman's name in his posts on Instagram. During the hearing, the woman was identified only by the initials "A B."
Cunningham, who was arrested last December at his Summit apartment when police responded to a domestic violence complaint, pleaded guilty to a third-degree crime of invasion of privacy and also pleaded guilty to fourth-degree charges of illegally transporting a handgun in the glove compartment of his car and having hollow-point bullets.
Cunningham said he had legally owned the gun in Florida before he brought it to New Jersey. As a result of his plea he also will be required to forfeit the gun.
Dressed in a suit and dress shirt with no tie, Cunningham gave short, polite responses, saying "Yes, your honor," to questions the judge asked about the guilty plea.
The judge said if Cunningham had gone to trial and been convicted of all the charges, he could face a maximum sentence of 18 years in prison.
Cunningham's arrest became one of the latest high-profile cases of what is known as "revenge ass."
He was charged under a New Jersey statute that makes it a crime to distribute assass images of someone without that person's consent. The 10-year-old law was the first in the nation to make the spreading of such images a crime.
In court, Daniel said that as part of the agreement, Cunningham will be permitted to serve the probationary term in Georgia, where he has relatives.
The length of the probation period Cunningham must serve will be set at sentencing on June 19.

The 18th edition of the stroll, a signature annual Huntsville event in which volunteers portray over 70 historic characters (many of which are buried here) and period musicians, takes place 2-4:30 p.m. Oct. 12 at Maple Hill Cemetery, address 202 Maple Hill St. S.E.
Huntsville Pilgrimage association sponsors the free event, which drew attendance of about 10,000 last year. Donations collected during the stroll are used exclusively for restoration at Maple Hill.
"It's probably 50 percent of our budget for the year or close to it," Huntsville Pilgrimage association president Margaret Milford says. "We just simply could not do the work without the money Cemetery Stroll brings in. In the historic sections of the cemetery we restore the monuments, and most of these old monuments if not all of them are marble which is very porous and crumbles, and there are special processes that have to be done. Most of the newer monuments will last longer because they are granite. Lately we've addressed some of the fencing and iron work."
Huntsville's past uncovered
An estimated 80,000 to 100,000 people are buried in the 75-acre Maple Hill Cemetery. Topper Birney's great-great-grandfather James G. Birney isn't one of them.
But James G. did reside in Huntsville and made a big impact here in the state, and later on, on the entire nation, and for the last 15 years or so Topper has portrayed his great-great-granddad in the Cemetery Stroll. He breaks out gray tails and a top hat for the occasion. On the afternoon of this interview he's wearing an Alabama jacket and seated at a round table inside the Maple Hill office.
"James G. moved to Huntsville in 1818," Topper says. "He was mayor of Huntsville and started an abolitionist newspaper. He eventually left Huntsville in 1832 and bounced all over the place trying to abolish slavery and ended up in Bay City, Michigan and ran for president twice, 1840 and 1844, and he didn't win. He was part of the Liberty Party and it was the first time abolitionism was on a presidential platform. He insisted that occur. The Liberty Party merged with the Whig party and this eventually became the Republican Party and in 1860 the Republicans ran a man named Abraham Lincoln for president, and everybody knows what happened to slavery under President Lincoln.
"So James G. from the grave got the last laugh."
ass Hinds Money is seated across Topper at that Maple Hill office table. This year she'll again portrayal a relative of hers, Lady Grace Hinds Curzon, who was born in a riverside Decatur house and went on to marry a wealthy South American landowner who left her a cool $25 million after he died. Curzon would go on to wed a former viceroy of Indian. Money, who collects antique clothes, often breaks out a black sequined 1920s evening dress to portray Curzon.
"The reason why I like this is there's so much history," says Money, who today is wearing floral capris and a white top. "If you want to learn about history in Huntsville and the surrounding area you need to come here because it is so interesting."
Longtime Cemetery Stroll volunteer Van Brown, a convention services manager who favors rectangular glasses, adds, "History's wonderful but it's the stories. Stories don't have dates; they're timeless. But I particularly come back every year because I watch the children grow up and there have been children that have been coming here for the last 15 years. The children are the ones that are going to pass on, talk about our history, and I think if they can see it rather than read it in a book I think they're going to learn just as much and take it with them."
Each year for the stroll, Brown pulls his cow costume out of the closet to depict Lily Flagg, the dairy cow that Huntsville planter/socialite Samuel B. Moore took to the 1892 World's Fair in Chicago, where Lily Flagg became a blue ribbon winner.
New history
Moore and Lily Flagg are some of the characters "you've got to have" in the Cemetery Stroll each year, says the event's 2014 chairperson Fred Ecklund. Other must-have perennial characters include the pioneer, lawyer and "Father of Huntsville" Leroy Pope, who sold Huntsville the land for Maple Hill Cemetery, which was deeded in 1822. There's the legendary local madam Molly Teal, who left her brothel building- and the land on which Huntsville Hospital is now located - to the city. Five former Alabama governors are buried at Maple Hill.
That said, some new characters have been added to the 2014 Cemetery Stroll. These include: Huntsville Times founder Jacob Emory Pierce ("Quite a flamboyant and controversial character," Ecklund says); and Rev. Bartley Harris (Ecklund describes him as, "minister of Alabama's oldest African American Baptist Church. He baptized over 3,000 people at Big Springs").
While history is rich at Maple Hill Cemetery there's not much parking here. Thus, the stroll offers free shuttles departing from Jackson Way Baptist Church (1001 Andrew Jackson Way) to here from 1:30 - 4:30 p.m. Things you'll want to bring to the stroll: comfortable clothes and walking shoes. Things you don't have to bring: bottled water, a cemetery map and event brochure detailing characters, all of which are provided. A quick tip: if you see a big crowd gathered around a character you'll want to come back to them later, as it will be easier to hear and get the full effect.
Nayernia says the technique could enable women to have a biological child with two mothers and no father. Their offspring would always be daughters, though, because sperm made from a female cell would always carry an X instead of a Y chromosome. Weirder still, a woman could conceivably use sperm made from her bone marrow to inseminate her own eggs.
Republican Rep. Denny Butler on Monday requested the recanvass, which is essentially a re-tabulation of votes in the district and not to be confused with the more rigorous recount.
Historically, recanvasses haven't yielded enough votes to change the outcome of elections in Kentucky.

On Tuesday, Democratic candidate McKenzie Cantrell said she's not worried about the challenge.
œA couple hundred votes is a pretty small margin, but it only reinforces our choices, that everything that we did mattered, Cantrell said. œEvery dollar that we raised, every door that we knocked on, every Facebook post, every comment, every phone call really made a difference.
The 38th House District was the only election in which Democrats were able to unseat an incumbent Republican, partly because of high Democratic Party registration and a strong union presence in the district.
Butler, a retired homicide detective, was a longtime Democrat but switched to the Republican Party just before this year's legislative session, saying he no longer shared the values of his former party.
Republicans unseated 17 incumbent Democratic representatives across the state on Election Day, blitzing to secure a majority of seats in the House for the first time since 1921.
Cantrell said that she wishes Democrats had performed better across the state, but that she would still be pushing for labor issues from the new minority party.
œI'm going to be a strong voice where I need to be and I'm going to cross the aisle and get things done where I need to, she said.
More surprising is the fact that GAE doesn't offer a scheduler. Your app can only get invoked when someone sends it an HTTP request and you can't ask GAE to generate a canned request every so often (crontab-style). That seems both limiting and arbitrary. In fact, I would be surprised if GAE didn't soon add support for this.
In the meantime, your best bet is to get an account on a separate server that lets you schedule jobs, at which point you can drive your GAE application from that external scheduler (through HTTP requests to your GAE app). But just for the intellectual exercise, how would one meet the need while staying entirely within the confines of the Google-provided infrastructure?
The most obvious option is to piggyback on HTTP requests from your visitors. But: this assumes that you consistently get visitors at a frequency greater than your scheduler's interval, since you can't launch sub-processes in GAE, this delays your responses to the visitor, more worrisome, if your scheduled task takes more than a few seconds this means your application might be interrupted by GAE before you respond to the visitor, resulting in a failed request from their perspective.
You can try to improve a bit on this by doing this processing not as part of the main request from your visitor but rather by putting in the response HTML some JavaScript that will asynchronously send you HTTP requests in the background (typically not visible to the user). This way, a given visitor will give you repeated invocations for as long as the page is open in the browser. And you can set the invocation interval. You can even create some kind of server-controlled auto-modulation of the interval (increasing it as your number of concurrent visitors increases) so that you don't eat all your Google-allocated incoming HTTP quota with these XMLHttpRequest invocations. This would probably be a very workable way to do it in practice even though: it only works if your application has visitors who use web browsers, not if it only consumed by programs (e.g. through RSS feeds or other XML format), it puts the burden on your visitors who may or may not appreciate it, assuming they realize it is happening (how would you feel if your real estate agent had to borrow your cell phone to arrange home visits for you and their other customers?).
While GAE doesn't offer a scheduler, another Google service, Google Reader, offers one of sorts. If you register a feed there, Google's FeedReader will retrieve it once a while (based on my logs, it happens approximately every hour for each of the two feeds for this blog). You can create multiple URLs that all map to the same handler and return some dummy RSS. If you register these feeds with Google Reader, they'll get pulled once a while. Of course there is no guarantee that the pulling of the different feeds will be nicely spread out, but if you register enough of them you should manage to get invoked with a frequency compatible with you desired scheduler's frequency.
That's all nice, but it doesn't entirely live within the GAE application. It depends on either the visitors or Google Reader. Can we do this entirely within GAE?
The idea is that since a GAE app can only executes within an HTTP request handler, which only runs for a few seconds, you can emulate a long-running process by automatically starting a successor request when the previous one is killed. This is made possible by two characteristics of the GAE runtime
When an HTTP request is canceled on the client side, the request execution on the server is permitted to continue (until it returns or GAE kills it for having run too long).
When GAE kills a request for having run too long, it does it through an exception that you have a chance to handle (at least for a few seconds, until you get killed for good), which is when you initiate the HTTP request that spawns the successor process.
If you've watched (or played) Rugby, this is equivalent to passing the ball to a teammate during that short interval between when you're tackled and when you hit the ground (I have no idea whether the ****ogy also applies to Rugby's weird cousin called American Football).
In practice, all you have to do is structure your long running task like this
class StartHandler(webapp.RequestHandler)
def get(self)
if (StopExec.all().count() == 0)
try
id = int(self.request.get("id"))
logging.debug("Request " + str(id) + " is starting its work.")
# This is where you do your work
finally
logging.debug("Request " + str(id) + " has been stopped.")
# Save state to the datastore as needed
logging.debug("Launching successor request with id=" + str(id+1))
res = urlfetch.fetch("http://myGaeApp.appspot.com/start?id=" + str(id+1))
Once you have deployed this app, just point your browser to http://myGaeApp.appspot.com/start?id=0 (assuming of course that your GAE app is called œmyGaeApp) and the long-running process is started. You can hit the œstop button on your browser and turn off your computer, the process (or more exactly the succession of processes) has a life of its own entirely within the GAE infrastructure.
The œif (StopExec.all().count() == 0) statement is my way of keeping control over the beast (if only Dr. Frankenstein had as much foresight). StopExec is an entity type in the datastore for my app. If I want to **** this self-replicating process, I just need to create an entity of this type and the process will stop replicating. Without this, the only way to stop it would be to delete the whole application through the GAE dashboard. In general, using the datastore as shared memory is the way to communicate with this emulation of a long-running process.
A scheduler is an obvious example of a long-running process that could be implemented that way. But there are other examples. The only constraint is that your long-running process should expect to be interrupted (approximately every 9 seconds based on what I have seen so far). It will then re-start as part of a new instance of the same request handler class. You can communicate state between one instance and its successor either via the request parameters (like the œid integer that I pass in the URL) or by writing to the datastore (in the œfinally clause) and reading from it (at the beginning of your task execution).
By the way, you can't really test such a system using the toolkit Google provides for local testing, because that toolkit behaves very differently from the real GAE infrastructure in the way it controls long-running processes. You have to run it in the real GAE environment.
Does it work? For a while. The first time I launched it, it worked for almost 30 minutes (that's a lot of 9 second-long processes). But I started to notice these worrisome warnings in the logs: œThis request used a high amount of CPU, and was roughly 21.7 times over the average request CPU limit. High CPU requests have a small quota, and if you exceed this quota, your app will be temporarily disabled.
And indeed, after 30 minutes of happiness my app was disabled for a bit.
My quota figures on the dashboard actually looked pretty good. This was not a very busy application.
CPU Used 175.81 of 199608.00 Gigacycles (0%)
Data Sent 0.00 of 2048.00 Megabytes (0%)
Data Received 0.00 of 2048.00 Megabytes (0%)
Emails Sent 0.00 of 2000.00 Emails (0%)
Megabytes Stored 0.05 of 500.00 Megabytes (0%)
But the warning in the logs points to some other restriction. Google doesn't mind if you use a given number of CPU cycles through a lot of small requests, but it complains if you use the same number of cycles through a few longer requests. Which is not really captured in the œunderstanding application quotas page. I also question whether my long requests actually consume more CPU than normal (shorter) requests. I stripped the application down to the point where the œthis is where you do your work part was doing nothing. The only actual work, in the œfinally clause, was to opens an HTTP connection and wait for it to return (which never happens) until the GAE runtime kills the request completely. Hard to see how this would actually use much CPU. Yet, same warning. The warning text is probably not very reflective of the actual algorithm that flags my request as a hog.
What this means is that no matter how small and slim the task is, the last line (with the urlfetch.fetch() call) by itself is enough to get my request identified as a hog. Which means that eventually the app is going to get disabled. Which is silly really because by that the time fetch() gets called nothing useful is happening in this request (the work has transitioned to the successor request) and I'd be happy to have it killed as soon as the successor has been spawned. But GAE doesn't give you a way to set client-side timeout on outgoing HTTP requests. Neither can you configure the GAE cop to **** you early so that you don't enter the territory of œthis request used a high amount of CPU.
I am pretty confident that the ability to set client-side HTTP timeout will be added to the urlfetch API. Even Google's documentation acknowledges this limitation: œNote: Since your application must respond to the user's request within several seconds, a URL fetch action to a slow remote server may cause your application to return a server error to the user. There is currently no way to specify a time limit to the URL fetch action. Of course, by the time they fix this they may also have added a real scheduler
Weeks ago, Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake debuted a new sketch called "The Evolution of Touchdown Dancing" and challenged NFL players to replicate their dance moves. In return, Fallon would pay any possible fine, and donate $10,000 to a charity of their choice.
When Fauria scored a touchdown on Sunday, he celebrated by doing "The Justin Timberlake" dance, as highlighted in the skit.
Tuesday night on "Late Night with Jimmy Fallon," Fallon announced he'd be making a $10,000 donation to Make-A-Wish Foundation in Fauria's name.
"I think NFL players are crazy," Fallon said. "I think they've all lost they're minds. This past Sunday, Detroit Lions rookie Joseph Fauria, he answered my challenge. We were all going nuts. We all saw it on Twitter and we were going crazy. Oh my gosh, he did the 'Justin Timberlake,' but he looked way cooler than I did doing it. He is a good guy. Thank you for dancing out there and keeping it fun."

Most of the time, the traps yield passerines: a male Common Yellowthroat tschat-tschat-tschatting, a handful of catbirds screeching their beaks off, an Indigo Bunting performing its frenzied routine. These species prove to be the best subjects; once they're banded and deemed healthy, they can be tapped for a whole slew of studies, says Luke DeGroote, avian ecologist and Bird Banding Program coordinator at Powdermill. Bioacoustics, radar tracking, and bird-safe glass testing are just a few examples.
The glass experiments, for one, may be the most unique and important research done at the center. Every year, 365 to 988 million birds in the United States perish after colliding with windows and other translucent structures. A major chunk of that occurs during spring and fall migration.
Powdermill is home to the only glass-testing tunnel in the country; any product looking to market itself as œbird-safe needs to pass muster here first. Manufacturers such as Arnold Glas, Guardian Industries, and Walker Glass create sample panes with stripes, dots (called fritting), and other patterns, and then send them to the center to be evaluated by its birds and scientists.
œA good prototype has a highly visible, high-density pattern that birds can easily see, says Christine Sheppard, Bird Collisions Campaign manager with the American Bird Conservancy (ABC), which certifies the products before they hit the market. Sheppard is the catalyst behind bringing glass testing to the States; she's also responsible for sparking ABC's partnership with Powdermill. Inspired by the work of Austrian ornithologist Martin RÃ¶ssler, Sheppard directed the construction of the tunnel in Rector in 2009. Since then, she and the center's staff have tested more than 150 different products with the help of thousands of banded birds. Of those, nine plus several items meant to deter avians from flying into glass, such as stickers and films were rated high enough to be deemed œbird-friendly.
The tunnel's rather modest appearance belies its scientific importance: It's a 25-foot-long wooden box, set on a swivel that allows it to be aligned with the sun. The structure is black and lined with foam on the inside, but the back end is open for two glass panes to be installed: one plain and one patterned. A sky-blue, cloud-dotted sheet adds backlighting to the panes. Meanwhile, a near-invisible net, stationed three feet in front of the glass, catches the avians before they can even hit it.
When releasing a bird into the space, the scientists first check its stress levels and take down any measurements and data. They then guide the subject into the tunnel's opening, which is covered by a child's pajama sleeve, allowing it to sit for a moment and get its bearings. The flight itself lasts less than a second, and is recorded by a camera mounted near the entrance.

œLook at him go, says Powdermill's tunnel technician Lauren Horner. She and Sheppard peer at the LCD monitor, watching a yellowthroat zip straight toward the glass end of the flyway. Right before it's about to collide, it veers to the left toward the experimental pane and is rescued by the netting. œWhile that looks like a clear avoidance, I'll have to check the video inside, frame by frame, Horner says. Each prototype goes through at least 80 trials; to get a passing grade, it needs to earn a 70 percent avoidance rate or above.
Horner clicks off the camera and then swings open a hatch door at the back left side of the tunnel. The yellowthroat is sitting there, perched on the edge of the mist net. With a swift flick of its wings, it propels itself out and up into the sky.
The DBC operated as the Davis Bike Church at the Domes at the University of California-Davis campus from 2004-2009.
Volunteers with the DBC began to notice that   gasp!   most of its customers were men. Thus, they felt they had to do something about this bicycle patriarchal hegemony.

WTF (Women Trans Femme) night is Bike Forth's response to the common view that bike maintenance is predominantly for men. œThe idea is for people who might feel uncomfortable coming to the shop in general to have a safe space to come and learn about bikes, said Anne Hereford, a volunteer at Bike Forth who helped initiate the latest incarnation of WTF night in Davis. œAt the shop it's a very supportive community, but some people still feel intimidated about coming to work on their bikes, specifically women and people who identify as women. We want to empower them to work on their bikes, and if that means having a special night where they can come and not feel intimidated then that's what we want to offer. Van Wyk, who is also responsible for the return of WTF night, said it started in Davis in 2008 and has made a few comebacks in the years since. After starting as a volunteer for the Bike Collective, she decided to begin a new iteration to help these marginalized groups get a handle on bike maintenance. œIf you don't know how to work on your bike it can often be intimidating, or you have the experience where you come in and someone says, ˜Let me do it for you,' Van Wyk said. œThis happens in mechanical realms. This happens across the spectrum in traditionally male-dominated activities. Part of addressing this intimidation includes limiting access to the shop on those Tuesdays to only people who identify with the WTF community. œWe don't exactly turn people away   we say, ˜Do you identify as part of this community?' Hereford said. œIf you don't feel you're a member of the Women Trans Femme community, this is not a space that you're invited to. So it's more of a self-selection. People who identify as men are encouraged to go to the shop's regular open hours on the other days of the week. œThere are still women and transgender people in our society who feel intimidated when they're in a male-dominated space, Hereford said. œFrankly, the shop is often male-dominated. If you go in on an afternoon that is not WTF you're likely to see more men than women.
So, it's not enough to have just a œbiking community   even that is broken down by the social justice warriors into the usual race/gender/ethnicity/assassass component parts.
And what a relief that the DBC doesn't exactly turn people away  but if you need bike service on that every other Tuesday   and you're a guy   you're either out of luck or you'll have to lie that you identify as œtrans-female. Or something. Good thing they're not a Christian bakery or pizza shop, eh?
œWTF indeed.

In a press conference, Aguirre said: œI believe that that's what the President said that when his war on drugs has been sabotaged by some people. This could be the police behind or in cahoots with the destabilizers or some people in the religious and the human rights groups.
ADVERTISEMENT
Aguirre said he had met with Philippine National Police National Capital Region Director Oscar Albayalde, who believed that the three slain teenagers Kian delos Santos, Carl Arnaiz, and Reynaldo œKulot de Guzman were œpurposely killed and their killers' moves were intended to œ'drive outrage from the Filipino people and blame the policemen.
œWhen the police are blamed, it will reflect on the President, katulad nung aking (similar with my) opinion that there's some sort of destabilization in connection with the killing of the three teenagers, he noted.
Aguirre mentioned the Catholic Church's taking custody of witnesses to alleged extrajudicial killings, and not allowing them to be interviewed by the police and National Bureau of Investigation (NBI).
He said that members of the Catholic Church œwanted to revive the, itong namamatay na International Criminal Court. Iyon pala darating si Callamard at dun nila gustong ipresenta itong mga teenage witnesses na ito.
(The Church wanted to revive the dying International Criminal Court. And Callamard, apparently, would arrive, and they want to present to her these teenage witnesses.)
The secretary was referring to the United Nations (UN) special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions Agnes Callamard. The envoy has rejected the Duterte administration's invitation to investigate the killings because of the preconditions set by the government, including a public debate with President Rodrigo Duterte, as it could compromise her independence, which would be contradictory to UN protocols.
Member-states of the UN Human Rights Council, however, have urged the Philippine government to allow Callamard to probe the Duterte administration's bloody war on drugs.
Aguirre also chided the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) for urging people who might be involved in alleged summary executions to surface and seek sanctuary in the Catholic Church.
œActually the Church even encouraged the populace, including the policemen, (to) surrender to them and they're going to take care of them. Di maganda e. Parang lumalabas na propaganda lamang yang announcement na yan (It's not good. It appears that the announcement is just propaganda). I don't know for whom, he added. /kga

The USA Freedom Act needed 60 Senate votes to pass its key procedural vote, and it failed to get them. The bill got 58 yes votes and 42 no votes.
The bill would have stopped the government from engaging in bulk phone surveillance. Instead, Americans' phone information would have remained with the phone companies and could only be searched by request, with specific selection terms.
It would have also provided for a privacy advocate at the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which approves such surveillance. Reformers hoped that would provide for a less one-sided debate at that court.
The bill had widespread support, not just from civil liberties groups but from law enforcement including the director of the NSA and even former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.
There are many other aspects of surveillance that came up since the Snowden leaks that the bill didn't address, such as surveillance of e-mail that was revealed as part of the PRISM program. It would have extended for two years certain aspects of the Patriot Act, such as "roving" wiretaps.
Supporters: Stop "secret courts, secret laws"
"Our bill protects Americans," said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), who introduced the bill. "It ends indiscriminate data collection, but keeps the tools our intelligence community needs to protect the nation."
Leahy again publicly debunked the reports that the bulk collection program had thwarted over 50 terrorist plots. "It may have possibly helped on one," he pointed out.
Opponents of the bill said the threat of terrorism necessitated the database.
"God forbid tomorrow morning we wake up to the news that a member of ISIL is in the United States," said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL).
The bulk collection program currently in place would allow intelligence agencies to quickly get their contacts, he said.
"We can disrupt that cell, before they can carry out a horrifying attack that kills hundreds of people," said Rubio.
"This bill advances the cause of safeguarding our nation, without in any way detracting from our security," said bill supporter Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT). "The founding fathers would have been shocked if they had heard of warrants being issued by a secret court, making secret law."
Opponents: A "needed tool" for fighting terror
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a longtime opponent of intelligence reform, made a surprising change of vote and pleaded with her colleagues to support the bill. She remains a defender of the program, pointing out that there were only 288 queries for metadata in 2013.
However, Feinstein felt if the bill didn't pass, it could lead to the program being thrown out altogether.
"If we didn't pass the House bill, there were members that wanted to end the whole program," said Feinstein. "I do not want to end the program. I'm prepared to make the compromise, which is that the metadata will be kept by the telecoms."
Feinstein said that she and Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-GA), the leading Republican on her intelligence committee, contacted four large telecom companies asking whether they would agree to keep the records needed. Two said they already were, and the other two ultimately committed to keeping the records for two years.
While Feinstein made a strategic switch, Chambliss wasn't prepared to do so. The existing program helps do things like find out if a group like ISIL is recruiting Americans, he said.
"We have any number of people, committed to jihad, that live in America," said Chambliss on the Senate floor. "This program gives the intelligence community all the tools they need to make sure that when ISIL recruits individuals, if they're Americans, we can find out about that."
After the vote, Leahy criticized the tone of the debate, lamenting "those who resort to scare tactics."
"Fomenting fear stifles serious debate and constructive solutions," he said. "This nation should not allow our liberties to be set aside by passing fears. America will always face the threat of terrorist attacks, from both outside our borders and inside."
He added that he won't give up the fight to pass this bill, or another like it.
"I swear that, to the Vermonters I serve and the Constitution I swore an oath to defend," said Leahy.
On Aug. 6, Japan launched its largest warship since World War II in a fresh demonstration of Tokyo's steadily expanding naval capabilities. The unveiling of the destroyer   with a conspicuously large flight deck   has drawn attention from its neighbors, especially longstanding regional rival China, which in the past decade has embarked on a massive program of military modernization.
Japan's pacifist constitution, which was largely drafted by the U.S. after the war, renounces the use of force for purposes other than self-defense. That means the country has no offensive arsenal of long-range missiles, aircraft carriers or similar weapons of aggression. The Izumo, which can be used to launch helicopters, still doesn't cross the line, the Japanese government says. But the almost 20,000-ton vessel is capable of carrying up to fourteen helicopters, with a maximum of five taking off and landing at once according to Bloomberg. It's set to be deployed by March of 2015. Tokyo says that the Izumo cannot carry planes, since it lacks the catapults necessary for seaborne take-off. Instead, officials maintain that the carrier will be used for disaster and rescue missions   in the aftermath of a tsunami, perhaps   as well as for responding to œvarious contingencies in waters near Japan, reports broadcaster NHK.
(MORE: For Better or Worse, Japan to Ease Reins on Its Military)
But Chinese officials, who remain cognizant of Japan's savage invasion and occupation of China some seven decades ago, say they aren't fooled. The helicopter carrier could be easily retrofitted for fighter jet capability, Zhang Junshe, a senior researcher at the People's Liberation Army Naval Military Studies Research Institute, told the state-run China Daily. œIt is an aircraft carrier, and Japan just called it a helicopter destroyer to downplay its aggressive nature, he said. (China recently debuted its first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning,a refurbished Soviet-era vessel.)
In recent years, territorial disputes between Japan and China have flared over uninhabited islands that Tokyo administers but Beijing claims. The return to power of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who campaigned on a nationalist platform, and the rise of Xi Jinping, China's new patriotically minded President, have further heightened distrust between the world's second and third largest economies.
(MORE: The Identity Crisis That Lurks Behind japan's Right-Wing Rhetoric)
The Chinese remain aggrieved that Tokyo has, to this day, only offered fumbling apologies for the savage bloodshed inflicted during World War II (apologies that are then undermined by the unrepentant utterances of Japanese right-wingers). Japan meanwhile frets over China's increasing regional assertiveness as the budding global power flexes new muscles in the neighborhood. Tokyo's response has been to place a new emphasis on its military capacity. In January, the country boosted its defense spending for the first time in a decade, albeit by 0.8%. Japan is also considering whether to ease restrictions on the use of its military, which is currently barred by the constitution from almost all activities but national defense. China's 2013 military spending, revealed in March, increased by 10.7% over the last year, although foreign ****ysts believe the hike may be even higher.
The spats between the two countries have stoked public sentiment on either side. A survey published Aug. 5 by Genron NPO, a Japanese think tank, and China Daily found that more than 90% of Japanese and Chinese citizens had unfavorable views of the other country. Last year, 64.5% of Chinese citizens reported unfavorable feelings toward Japan, while 84.3% of Japanese felt the same way of their neighbors to the west.

Seeing death can also give people a rush, as long as it's from a safe distance. In flipping through images of, say, Princess Diana's fatal car accident, we get the thrill of feeling close to danger without actually being in danger. œYou're safe in your seat behind your computer, Saltz says.
But people are also drawn to looking at tragedy in order to confront humans' greatest fear.
œWe are probably more afraid of death than anything else, Saltz says. œThe fascination with viewing someone who is [dead]  is driven by that sort of supreme fear of ours which makes us want to know more and to understand the experience and feel like we have some kind of window in. It could be a way of trying to feel prepared for something we can never truly be ready for.
It could also be schadenfreude.
œ[It's] partially driven by the wish to have the things they imagine the celebrities have, Saltz says. œI can feel less terrible about [the fact that] I don't get to have it because look at the price you pay: You pay with your life.
Scott Bonn, a professor of criminology and sociology at Drew University, agrees. People œlove disasters of all sorts, he says. A dead celebrity photo, for some, is reassurance. œThe average person  their lives are rather mundane and not that happy. These things divert our attention and remind us after all, as mundane and  *** ty as my life might be, it's not that bad.
Bonn wrote a book about America's obsession with serial killers. He says that reading about the heinous crimes committed by John Wayne Gacy or Jeffery Dahmer, or looking at pictures of the murder scenes, are ways of getting a cheap thrill, like watching a scary movie. œIt's a form of escapism, Bonn says. œThere's an inherent need to get close to the edge of the abyss and look in without falling in.
But that's nothing new. In 1934, hordes swarmed the just-ambushed automobile of gangsters Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, snipping off locks of hair and flipping open pocket knives to slice ears and fingers off the notorious criminals.
Compared to that, looking at pictures online seems almost benign.

The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) has long doubted the pipe caused the delays, but in court documents filed Monday, the state takes direct aim at STP's argument that WSDOT failed to disclose the steel pipe in Bertha's path.
The documents, filed in Thurston County Superior Court, say the contractor's claim for hundreds of millions of dollars to cover the additional cost of delays and repairs to the tunnel boring machine should be thrown out, arguing it's not the state's fault that STP "forgot" about the steel pipe.
The state's motion includes excerpts from depositions of STP workers who documented the steel pipe's location in late 2011. A manager's email, cited in the motion, states that the pipe was "right in line" with the tunnel boring machine's path and would œhave to be closed down before we tunnel.

At issue is a pipe labeled as TW-2 on geotechnical maps created years before the Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement project began. STP told WSDOT that it cannot be held liable for project delays because it was told TW-2 was a small diameter PVC pipe made of plastic -- something Bertha could easily chew through.
"STP's claim is objectively unreasonable," WSDOT wrote in the motion. "Moreover, none of STP's employees ever relied on (or even thought about) the 'two-inch PVC' theory until it was invented months after the TBM struck TW-2."
After Bertha ran through the 8-inch steel pipe in December 2013, a portion of the well casing stuck up out of the ground. This photo was included in the July 24 motion for summary judgment.
A hearing on the state's motion is set for Sept 1.
Multiple lawsuits resulted from the December 2013 incident, when the steel pipe was blamed for damaging Bertha's cutterhead. STP is suing the state for as much as $480 million. Meanwhile, the company and its insurers are suing Bertha's manufacturer -- Hitachi Zosen -- alleging design flaws by the Japanese company. And the city of Seattle is suing the state and STP over damage to water infrastructure and other costs caused by the project.
Bertha was stranded for two years while a large pit was dug down so that the cutterhead could be hoisted to the surface and repaired. The process further delayed digging on the project that was originally scheduled to be done just over a year after it began in July 2013.
Laura Newborn, a WSDOT spokeswoman, said the tunnel is on schedule to be open to traffic in early 2019.
Bertha: How Did We Get Here?
The tunnel is nine years in the making, as then Governor Christine Gregoire announced plans to tear down the Alaskan Way Viaduct in January 2008. A year later, the state, county, and city announced an agreement to replace the Viaduct with a tunnel.
By spring 2009, Gregoire approved a $2.8 billion funding plan. However, litigation is now underway to determine who will pay for the nearly $500 million in cost overruns.
Four years after the funding was approved, the world's largest tunneling machine was shipped from a factory in Japan to Seattle. Crews assembled Bertha in three months, and she started digging July 30, 2013.
Project managers expected the nearly two-mile tunnel to be done in just over a year.
By December, Bertha was in trouble. The giant machine was overheating, and she dug in fits and starts as managers attempted to figure out what was wrong.
In January 2014, Bertha stopped and didn't start digging for another two years. The problems were tied to seals and bearings.
Bertha resumed the dig in January 2016, but the problems continued. A sinkhole formed near the digging site, causing the project to be put on hold. Digging resumed after it was determined safe.
By April 2016, Bertha was back on track with just one more course correction in March 2017. Seattle Tunnel Partners discovered Bertha had veered about six inches off course. After adjustment, Bertha chugged along for the final 960 feet.

In coming decades it may be possible to use brain imaging as legal evidence.
Carrie Peyton Dahlberg, Contributor
(Inside Science) -- Brain imaging can already pull bits of information from the minds of willing volunteers in laboratories. What happens when police or lawyers want to use it to pry a key fact from the mind of an unwilling person?
Will your brain be protected under the Fourth Amendment from unreasonable search and seizure?
Or will your brain have a Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination?
œThese are issues the United States Supreme Court is going to have to resolve, said Nita Farahany, a professor of law and philosophy at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, who specializes in bioethical issues.
Those legal choices are likely decades away, in part because the exacting, often finicky process of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) could be thwarted if a reluctant person so much as swallowed at the wrong time. Also, a brain exam couldn't be admitted in court unless it worked well enough to meet the legal standards for scientific evidence.
Still, the progress being made in œbrain decoding is so intriguing that legal scholars and neuroscientists couldn't resist speculating during a law and memory session earlier this month at the annual conference of the American association for the Advancement of Science in San Jose, California.
Our brains are constantly sorting, storing and responding to stimuli. As researchers figure out exactly where and how the brain encodes information, the fMRI also becomes a tool that can decode that information. The fMRI can identify the portions of the brain that are active, based on the increased quantity of freshly oxygenated blood they draw. Already, brain decoding can perform a version of that old magician's trick   guess what card someone is looking at   with better than 90 percent accuracy, University of California, Berkeley neuroscientist Jack Gallant told the group.
Farahany predicts that like most new science, brain decoding will break into the courtroom for the first time through a cooperative witness, someone who wants to use it to advance his or her case.
Stanford University law professor Henry Greely, who moderated the Feb. 13 law and memory session, suggested that a court might be especially open to novel techniques during the sentencing hearing in a death penalty case.
Both agreed that compelling someone to undergo a brain scan, the way a person might now be ordered to provide a urine sample or a DNA swab, would come much later. Even if the scan method were so non-invasive that some might argue it isn't a search at all, Farahany thinks the courts will probably decide it is, and so will consider that you are protected from œunreasonable brain searches. That, though, only means the authorities would need a search warrant for your brain.
As to self-incrimination, people cannot invoke the Fifth Amendment now to withhold certain purely physical information from their bodies, such as fingerprints. A court might draw parallels, she said, to brain activity.
Farahany has been monitoring early attempts to bring brain science into the courtroom with some sort of fMRI lie detection. So far, she said, no court has admitted it into evidence, concluding there is no scientific consensus that it works dependably.
Lie detection could prove much tougher than the more basic decoding going on in the lab, said Gallant, because lies are nuanced things, springing from a wide range of motives and emotional states.
Gallant is one of the best known researchers in a field that has been glibly described as computerized mind-reading. It is far from that, but brain decoding has made dramatic advances in visual imagery in Gallant's lab. Some of his recent work has involved asking volunteers to watch a compilation of video clips showing brief glimpses of short scenes while an fMRI measures the oxygenation of blood in different parts of their brains. His lab's computer models can then determine what that person might be watching when shown new video clips, ones that he or she has never seen before. This decoding can pick up general categories: woman, man, people talking, buildings or the ocean. But it won't stop there.
œBrain decoding is going to keep getting better and better, he said, because our understanding of how the brain encodes keeps growing. The two move in tandem, as inseparable as two sides of the same piece of toast.
We won't need to wait for lie detector test results before brain decoding is capable of extracting information an investigator might want, such as the encryption code to a file or the combination to a safe.
œYou could easily decode a number sequence from somebody's brain from fMRI now. Internal, unpublished data from my lab suggests that would not be difficult to do, Gallant said in a phone interview a few days after his talk.
What you couldn't do, he said, is decode numbers from the brain of a squirming, uncooperative person who wants to mess with the MRI machine.
œNo way, Gallant said.
Not in our lifetimes. But in our children's lifetimes? He's pretty sure that improved techniques will emerge.
Now, after KRK's disparaging Twitter tirade against Mohanlal, the cyber warriors are back in action. Apparently, the tech geeks' group have already warned KRK to delete his tweets or face repercussions.
The cyber warriors took to their Facebook group and posted thus, along with a photo of Mohanlal: œAfter the tweet made by KRK against our Lalettan, Mallu Cyber Soldiers admin panel called for an immediate meeting to go for a cyber attack against KRK... some of the best hackers and cyber experts from different parts of state soon joined with us and started to dig out his information and discovered his private email address. After a few hours, we were able to break into one of his email through which we got access to KRK's Twitter and Facebook recover email. When we informed KRK that his email has been compromised, he didn't reply but removed his first post against Lalettan in a few minutes. We also provided proof of our login.
"However, we have decided to launch a cyber attack on one of his main income source - his adsense account... Mr KRK, forget your ad earnings, we are now going to shut down your Google ad revenue account.''
In October 2014, when Mohanlal's official page, The Complete Actor, was hacked, the Mallu Cyber Soldiers retaliated by breaking into several official Pakistani websites like National University of Modern Languages, Lahore campus (NUML) and Pakistan Electric Power Company (PEPCO).
Of late, certain self-proclaimed cyber activists have been on the radar of investigating agencies for 'retaliatory' hacking of websites and for 'instigating' wrong passions.
The players' interactions with the media are an example of that.
Pernell McPhee and Willie Young can turn interviews into stand-up routines full of quotes perfect for the nightly news. Sam Acho can preach and teach. Lamarr Houston can go from calm off the field to brash on it. And Leonard Floyd, perhaps the best of the bunch, can say little.
˜˜I would have been supremely disappointed if there weren't [personalities],'' Staley said with a laugh. ˜˜It's a great room. I've gotten to spend a lot of time with these guys one-on-one. Going out to eat, being in their homes and stuff like that is really important to me to establish that type of relationship.''
Bears OLB Pernell McPhee. (AP)
What has he learned about them as a group?
˜˜It's a group that's really willing,'' Staley said. ˜˜This is a group that's anxious to prove itself.''
In many ways, the players already have. They've been productive starters, including veteran newcomer Dan Skuta. But they also feel as though they let the team down last season. They were expected to be one of the Bears' strengths, a relentless unit of pass rushers with different sizes, skills and styles.
Instead, injuries limited their effectiveness. McPhee appeared in only nine games after having knee surgery last offseason, then had surgery for a torn shoulder labrum this offseason. Houston suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in Week 2. Floyd missed several practices and four games because of various ailments, including two concussions. Young played through injuries and needed arthroscopic knee surgery this offseason.
˜˜You can feel the pride that these guys have,'' Staley said. ˜˜That's something that the every-day fan doesn't see. It's the pride that these guys have in their performance and how much it means to them. They're anxious to recapture that productivity and also recapture that spirit of our team.''
The Bears have little choice but to be confident in those players at this point. Other than adding Skuta in free agency, the position essentially went unchanged during the offseason.
The Bears' need to pursue other outside linebackers became less pressing because they were encouraged by McPhee's and Houston's rehabilitation efforts. The Bears even moved Roy Robertson-Harris, a promising undrafted free-agent signee last year, to the defensive line.
˜˜Just staying healthy is the key,'' McPhee said.
He said the players have the right mindset.
˜˜Dominate [and] destroy every opponent that we face,'' McPhee said. ˜˜Just showing the world why they actually got these guys in the room   me, Leonard, Willie, Lamarr, Sam. Just dominate in the NFL. That's what I want us to do, and that's what I think we're going to do.''
There are reasons to be optimistic, starting with defensive coordinator Vic Fangio being more hands-on after former outside linebackers coach Clint Hurtt left the team. Fangio's expertise with linebackers stretches beyond his days with the San Francisco 49ers. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, he coached a New Orleans Saints linebacker corps that featured four Pro Bowl players. He also coached Hall of Famer Kevin Greene with the Carolina Panthers.
˜˜From [Fangio's] past, he's worked with some Hall of Fame, All-Pro, Pro Bowl guys,'' Young said. ˜˜He has the experience and the knowledge to get us where we want to be and where he wants us to be.''
Expectations are high for what McPhee and Floyd can be in their second season together. According to ****ysis by Pro Football Focus, McPhee and Floyd were the third- and fourth-best outside linebackers in terms of ˜˜highest pass-rush productivity'' in the final five weeks of last season.
A McPhee-Floyd tandem can be an imposing blend of strength and speed. Overall, Fangio's and Staley's aptitude for mixing and matching the various strengths of the outside linebackers is worth watching.
˜˜More than anything, these guys want to win,'' Staley said. ˜˜And that drive . . . it's being as good as you can be because you know that you can help the team. From our group, that's what they know: ˜When we've been healthy, our team has played better. When we've been out of the lineup and banged up, it hasn't gone as well.' They're just anxious to get out there to help the team.''
EXTRA POINTS
The right stuff
The Bears are asking rookie quarterback Mitch Trubisky to change aspects of his game as he makes the transition from North Carolina's shotgun-heavy system.
For the most part, though, the team will leave his throwing motion alone. The difficulties will be maintaining that motion despite different footwork.
˜˜Yeah, they're not really messing with [my throwing motion],'' Trubisky said. ˜˜It's more of my footwork. My throwing motion is what it is. I've got a quick release, and I could throw the ball accurately as long as I bring my feet with me.
˜˜So that's what [quarterbacks] coach [Dave Ragone] says: ˜Do the footwork. Bring your feet with you. Get through your progression and use your eyes well.' So as long as my shoulders are level and I pull through with my hips, the ball should be where it's supposed to go.''
Offense needs work
With only veteran minicamp remaining in the Bears' offseason program, it's apparent the defense is ahead of the offense. That's to be expected, especially with notable changes at quarterback, receiver and tight end.
But outside linebacker Willie Young said he sees some good things in the works for the offense.
˜˜As I go back and watch film from the previous practices and whatnot, I see a lot of upside,'' Young said. ˜˜Upside is one thing, but what we actually do and what we're actually able to put together during the process could be a completely different story. Time will tell.''
He and other defensive veterans know how they can help.
˜˜The key is going to be to keep getting after those guys [on offense] and making those younger guys better,'' Young said.
Getting Goldman right
Nose tackle Eddie Goldman said his goal is to ˜˜re-establish myself'' after missing most of last season because of a high sprain of his
left ankle.
Goldman can do that by strengthening the ankle but also by maintaining his fitness with the summer break coming up. He needs to be mindful of his weight.
˜˜It's been the same throughout the course of my time here,'' said Goldman, who weighed 336 pounds at the combine in 2015. ˜˜It's, like, 325 pounds.''
Goldman said his quickness and strength have improved since the Bears drafted him.
˜˜I would like to think I added a lot,'' Goldman said. ˜˜But the season is the true test, and summer camp is a true test. We'll just have to see.''

Hawaii is suffering through an unprecedented drought -- El Nino conditions in the Pacific have added new misery to a half-century of declining rainfall on the tropical island chain. A two-year dry spell has fueled wildfires and destroyed crops from Oahu to the Big Island.
Big Island resident Judy Han ***  recalls the day a month ago that she told her husband that a nearby road, full of dry trees and plants, was at risk for a fire.
Soon after that dinner-table conversation, wildfire broke out.
"It's so dry that it was just explosive, almost, you know. I mean, the fire just took off like mad," Han ***  says.
Today, her lush green front yard stands in contrast to the dry and charred land surrounding it. Miraculously, the fire in late July stopped short of her home, at a stone wall about 100 yards away. The couple's home is atop Mount Kohala, on the northern tip of the island.
The entire state of Hawaii is dry. But the Big Island, about 160 miles southeast of Honolulu, is ground zero for the drought. Kevin Kodama, a hydrologist for the National Weather Service, says that some swaths of the Big Island are the driest places in the United States.
"They were on pace to set all-time records for the driest year ever," he says. "And you're talking about stations that have over 50 years of record. So this is very unusual."
It's also very costly -- especially for the up to 60,000 people in Hawaii who depend on rain for their fresh water.
Robin Lamson, who lives on the southern tip of the Big Island, has a 20,000-gallon steel-sided catchment tank in his backyard. Banging on the side of the tank, he says he has about a quarter of a tank left.
Lamson estimates that he's spent $600 more this year paying water haulers to fill his tank. He says that while this part of the island has always been relatively dry, "we have not had more than 2 inches of rain in nine months, and that's been a little sprinkle at a time -- an eighth of an inch, maybe."
The trees around his house are dying now, Lamson says. And Hawaii's crops are dying too: The entire state has been designated an agricultural disaster area by the federal government, enabling farmers to apply for special loans.
South Kona coffee grower Jason Stith says he is seriously considering a loan, to help him cope with the conditions.
Pulling on a branch from a coffee tree growing out of rocky volcanic soil, Stith points out how the beans are suffering from a lack of water. "They don't have a lot of mucilage or juice in them -- they're dry," he says. "They should be full and plump, and they just aren't. You can see it even in the green cherry."
The ocean twinkles off in the distance. Despite this serene location, Stith says he felt depressed after picking coffee on a recent day. He estimates that 50 percent of the crop has been damaged by the drought.
"I'm just amazed that they hang on at all," he said, before adding, with a touch of gallows humor, "I think it's the caffeine in the coffee that keeps 'em going."
The pain of the drought isn't just felt on the Big Island. Wildfires have charred parts of Maui. And on the east side of Oahu, mandatory water restrictions are in effect, thanks to a critically low reservoir.
On Sunday, a decorated U.S. military officer systematically (and intentionally) slaughtered sixteen Afghan Muslim civilians. Nine children and three women were among the dead. It was œa three-hour rampage [that] was allowed to happen: the perpetrator œwalk[ed] from house to house in the quiet of night opening fire on residentsIn one house, he piled eleven bodies together and set them on fire
Imagine for a moment if the roles had been reversed, if it had been an Afghan Muslim man who set a house of eleven American civilians on fire, killing them inside. Would there be any doubt that the U.S. media would be labeling this an act of terrorism and the suspect a terrorist? Would we not be subjected to panel discussions by œterrorism experts who would remind us of the dangers of Islamic radicalism and of œhomegrown extremism?
Yet, nary a soul in the establishment (the media or the government) has called the slaughter of sixteen Afghan Muslim civilians“of which nine were children and three were women“an act of œterrorism. Nobody has called the perpetrator a œterrorist. That label is strictly reserved for Muslims, and is completely off-limits to U.S. soldiers and Americans (unless they happen to be American Muslims, in which case they are œhomegrown terrorists).
What is the name of the American perpetrator and what is his religion? Does anybody know? In fact, the media has protected his name from disclosure and there is absolutely no mention of his faith whatsoever. Could he be one of the many Christian extremist nuts in the U.S. military? Where is the wild speculation by the American media about the looming threat of Christian radicalism and the danger it poses?
Had this been a Muslim, the headlines would blare œTERRORIST. Not only is this not the case with our American soldier, but amazingly, there are articles seeking to justify and mitigate his heinous act of terrorism. The NY Daily News published this article
Soldier accused of killing 16 Afghan civilians saw his buddy's leg blown off the day before the massacre, his lawyer says Suspect is highly decorated combat veteran who lost part of his foot in Iraq last year The American staff sergeant suspected of gunning down 16 Afghan civilians saw his buddy's leg blown off the day before the massacre, his lawyer said Thursday. œWe have been informed that at this small base that he was at, somebody was gravely injured . . . and that affected all the soldiers, lawyer John Henry Browne said.
The New York Times reported“and other media outlets repeated this claim“that the soldier was œsuffering from the stress of a fourth combat tour. Another explanation given was that the soldier was simply drunk.
If that were not enough, the soldier must have had a œbrain injury and œmarital problems; ABC News reported
Soldier Held in Afghan Massacre Had Brain Injury, Marital Problems The Army staff sergeant who allegedly went on a rampage and killed 16 Afghans as they slept in their homes had a traumatic brain injury at one point and had problems at home after his last deployment, officials told ABC News.
The perpetrator's œbuddy, a military man and member of an occupying force, had his leg injured (how dare the Afghans fight back!), and somehow this explains why the perpetrator killed sixteen Afghan civilians? Is it even conceivable that such justifications would have been raised had it been an Afghan Muslim who had killed sixteen Americans on the streets of New York?
Afghan Muslims see their children maimed, their entire families exterminated, and whole villages obliterated. Yet, the U.S. media wouldn't let any of this mitigate an act of terrorism committed by an Afghan Muslim against Americans. On the other hand, œmarital problems explains why the American soldier did what he did.
Remember the Fort Hood Shooting? A Muslim had killed thirteen U.S. soldiers, who were being deployed to join an occupying force in the Muslim world. That was labeled an act of Terrorism (with a capital ˜T'), unanimously condemned as such in the mainstream media. Yet, here we have an American soldier targeting and killing sixteen Afghan Muslim civilians, but I have yet to see the U.S. media labeling this an act of terrorism.
The rule is clear: it's only terrorism when Muslims do it. It's certainly never terrorism when America does it. As George Orwell put it: œActions are held to be good or bad, not on their own merits, but according to who does them.
When it's a Muslim perpetrator, the media will interview the victims' families and eulogize the dead, personalizing them by giving detailed accounts of their life stories, their dreams and aspirations. Meanwhile, the Afghan dead are nameless and faceless. The only images available of the attack are of angry Afghans burning U.S. flags in response“look how violent they are!
If it's a Muslim crime, the media will quickly link it to other Muslim individuals and organizations using six degrees of associations. But when an American soldier does it, then the media reassures us, using official government responses as a cue, that this was a lone wolf or rogue soldier. This, despite the fact that eyewitnesses say that it was a group of U.S. soldiers who did the deed, not just one man. This, despite the fact that a nearby U.S. military base allowed the rampage to continue for three hours.
If it's a Muslim crime, we are told that it fits a sustained pattern of Islamic terrorism. But when the U.S. soldier killed sixteen, we're told that it's a one-off rogue attack. This, even though œ[t]he latest killing of civilians by an American soldier isn't an outlier at all. Political commentator Nima Shirazi writes
Such œisolated incidents have been obliterating the lives of Afghan civilians for over a decade. Between January and May 2010, members of a U.S. Army Stryker brigade, who called themselves the œKill Team, executed three Afghans   a 15-year-old boy, a mentally assassed man and a religious leader   and then staged combat situations to cover up the killings, snapped commemorative and ghastly celebratory photographs with the murdered corpses, and took fingers and teeth as trophies. Peggy Noonan might say that they thought barbarity was their right. To date, 11 soldiers have been convicted in connection to the murders. Last year, one of the soldiers, Spc. Jeremy Morlock of Wasilla, Alaska, was sentenced to 24 years in prison for his role in the killings. One of the leaked **** Team photos shows œMorlock smiling as he holds a dead man up by the hair on his head. At the beginning of his court-martial, Morlock bluntly told the judge, œThe plan was to **** people, sir. He may be eligible for parole in less than seven years. Then there was the online video showing four giddy U.S. Marines urinating on the bodies of three slain Afghan men while saying things like œHave a good day, buddy and œGolden like a shower. One of the soldiers was the platoon's commanding officer. Just a few weeks later, American troops at Bagram Air Base deliberately incinerated numerous copies of the Quran and other religious texts, sparking mass riots across Afghanistan and leading to a rash of killings of U.S. and NATO soldiers by Afghans armed and trained by NATO. Just two days ago, in the eastern Afghan province of Kapisa, œNATO helicopters apparently hunting Taliban insurgents instead fired on civilians, killing four and wounding three others.
Shirazi pointed out elsewhere
Just last month, on Feb. 8, 2012, a NATO airstrike killed several children in the eastern Kapinsa province of Afghanistan, with œyoung Afghans of varying ages identified among the casualties. Similar strikes were responsible for the deaths   no, murder   of nearly 200 civilians last year alone. In less than 10 months from 2010 to early 2011, well over 1,500 Afghan civilians were killed by U.S. and NATO forces in night raids, a brutal occupation tactic that has been embraced   along with drone attacks   by President Barack Obama. According to a September 2011 study by the Open Society Foundation, œAn estimated 12 to 20 night raids now occur per night, resulting in thousands of detentions per year, many of whom are non-combatants. These raids produce heavy civilian casualties and often target the wrong people.
The stories of American atrocities are numerous. Furthermore, the death count from them is astronomically high: œa reasonable upper bound for Muslim fatalities [caused by the United States]is well over one million. Meanwhile, Muslim terrorists have killed zero civilians in the United States in the entire last decade. Far more Americans die of lightning and peanuts than Islamic terrorism.
The United States has killed œover one million Muslims, but when an American soldier kills Muslim civilians, it's a œone-off event and does not at all reflect the outstanding work of the U.S. military. Muslims œhave killed zero civilians in the United States but when a Muslim terrorist does something, then the crime fits a well-established pattern of Islamic radicalism.
This is War Propaganda 101. The threat posed by one's œenemy is exaggerated to no end (even though you have a higher chance of dying from lightning or peanuts), whereas the atrocities committed by one's own country are glossed over or denied altogether (you can't possibly compare American military intervention to Islamic terrorism!). (When it comes to the United States, œintervention is the proper term, not œterrorism.)
This double standard comes to mind with the recent reporting of a Moroccan man being arrested for allegedly plotting to bomb a synagogue in Italy. The media used such titles: œItalian police arrest terrorism suspect. Compare that title to this one: œAfter U.S. soldier allegedly kills 16 civilians, Afghans voice rage and Taliban vows revenge. Could we ever expect to read a major news outlet using the title œAfter U.S. terrorist kills It's simply unthinkable.
Notice too how the latter title makes it sound as if it is the Afghans who are the violent ones: they are in a œrage and œvow revenge. Americans respond with œsteadfast resolve and œdemand justice, but Afghan Muslims respond with œrage and œvow revenge.
American coverage of this most recent U.S. atrocity focused on: (a) finding justifications for the attack, and (b) the œviolent reaction of the victim population. Little attention was given to the act itself, and nowhere was it called terrorism. The Moroccan suspect killed zero people. He is from the start a œterrorist, whereas no body count“no atrocity (other than converting to Islam)“could earn the American soldier that title.
That zero civilians died from this latest (alleged) Islamic terrorist plot is unsurprising: in fact, the vast majority of Islamic terrorist plots are foiled or otherwise unsuccessful. There have been very few deadly attacks of Islamic terrorism in the West. But, that doesn't stop the media from talking about them endlessly or hyping their threat. Meanwhile, American atrocities are very œsuccessful and result in casualties in the thousands or even hundreds of thousands yet they do not warrant much discussion at all.
We live in a truly Orwellian time: ants are portrayed as menacing beasts, while the elephants that routinely stomp all over them are made to look like their hapless victims.
Romney would reduce taxes, control spending, limit and improve regulation, make social security and Medicare sustainable, reform healthcare according to a market model, and devise sensible energy policy.
All very good stuff. After these past three years of quite the opposite, as we've suffered with 13 million unemployed, we need all of these things.
But one big thing is missing. Where is the plank on monetary reform?
Ever since the Federal Reserve started its money-printing exercises when the Great Recession hit (indeed even before, as the Fed stoked the housing bubble), the public has been onto the fact that something is wrong with this nation's monetary order. Hence the Rep. Ron Paul (and Herman Cain) presidential candidacy last year, the big sales of Rep. Paul's book End the Fed, and the run-ups in commodity prices typified by gold at $1600 an ounce.
It's been pretty clear to people in general this past half decade that the Fed has acted inappropriately as we have endured the preamble to the economic crisis as well as the thing itself. It would appear that to the public at large, no program to rescue our economy from its terrible funk could possibly be credible unless it gives primacy of place to monetary concerns.
Yet we got no mention of this from Romney's 400 experts. The funny thing about this is that over the last thirty years ever since Ronald Reagan we have achieved virtually everything on the economists-for-Romney list. We have gotten major tax reduction several times over the last three decades; a nice reduction in spending (in the 1990s); a slowdown of regulations (under Reagan); a bipartisan commission reform of social security (in 1983); and substantial decontrol of energy markets (in the 1980s and the 2000s). Everything on the list, with the exception of health-care reform (and even here there were health savings accounts), has in fact been ingrained in policy in substantial fashion in recent memory.
And yet bam we got this mothering economic crisis of 2008-2012, the one with no end in sight, anyway.
Experts have been slow to criticize the Fed throughout this experience. A gap has thus emerged between titled opinion and that of the public as to what lies at the center of our straightened economic circumstances.
Why this is so is not entirely clear. One reason, surely, is the fact that Fed-bashing has taken on a hearty populist hue. This means that the paladins of economics will by nature strive to differentiate themselves from the mob and excuse the Fed.
This is a worrisome tendency in economics, on two counts. The first is that the vox populi is probably onto something. Why should the profession risk being wrong on such an important issue?
There is perhaps no institution in our government that has been so cornered by economists as the Fed. The Fed is the place most dominated by the credentialed Ph.D.'s of the profession. It would rankle economists to concede that despite this capture of the Fed by their ranks, the Fed was at fault for causing the worst economic crisis in eons. It would implicate the profession in the whole mess.
The other problem, more prosaic, concerns the Romney campaign. The public (which is to say the electorate) largely thinks that the Fed has blood on its hands in this crisis, and that it needs to be reformed if not attenuated in order for real recovery to come. Naturally, a campaign interested in getting votes should seek to appeal to the public on these grounds. Yet the 400 economists shied away from the matter entirely.
When Ronald Reagan was running for office in 1980, the Fed was behaving badly, if in a very obvious way in that the yearly inflation rate was 13%. One of Reagan's explicit economic planks was for reform of monetary policy. Reagan even had a task force of economists devoted to the matter. Reagan didn't hide from the issue of monetary policy and the Fed, and he won in a landslide.
The FBI is seeking two men pictured with a suitcase that allegedly contained a bomb which failed to explode in New York on Saturday.
The pair appeared to remove the explosive device from the luggage before taking the bag with them.
Authorities are looking to question the two men and recover the suitcase.
The device was allegedly planted by Ahmad Rahami, an Afghan-born, New Jersey resident who is facing charges in connection to twin blasts.
An FBI "seeking information" poster says the two men "allegedly located a piece of luggage on the sidewalk, removed an improvised explosive device from the luggage, and then left the vicinity leaving the device behind but taking the luggage".
Investigators have said the suitcase was left at West 27th Street in Manhattan by 28-year-old Mr Rahami.
The 27th Street bomb never exploded.
But at around the same time another explosive device detonated on West 23rd Street in the Chelsea neighbourhood, injuring 31 people.

Police had earlier said they believed the two men did not appear to be related to the plot.
But in Wednesday's poster it said agents are "interested in speaking to these individuals and recovering the luggage".
Mr Rahami has been charged in relation to the New York explosion and another device that exploded harmlessly hours earlier near a race in Seaside Park, New Jersey.

Mr Rahami was subsequently arrested after a shootout with police. He remains in hospital.
A handwritten journal found on Mr Rahami at the time of his arrest revealed that he had planned a suicide attack and hoped to be martyred rather than caught, according to a federal court complaint filed on Tuesday.
Journal entries from the bloodied book showed his disdain for the US government and included references to Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born Muslim cleric who was killed in a 2011 drone strike, the Boston Marathon bombings, the 2009 Fort Hood shootings in Texas and Osama bin Laden.
Mr Rahami wrote: "The sounds of the bombs will be heard in the streets."

"Death to your oppression," a final message read.
The entries did not appear to make any reference to the so-called Islamic State.
Authorities also said Mr Rahami ordered citric acid, ball bearings and electronic igniters on eBay and had them delivered to a business where he worked in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, on 12 September.
A recording on a relative's mobile phone showed Mr Rahami testing out the material in a backyard just two days before the attacks.
After his arrest, federal authorities admitted that they had looked into Mr Rahami in 2014, when his father expressed concern after a domestic dispute involving his son.
"The FBI conducted internal database reviews, interagency checks and multiple interviews, none of which revealed ties to terrorism," the FBI said in a statement.

After trying to claim that her liberal view of Christianity was righteous by citing 1 Corinthians 13:12 and arguing that œwe too often misinterpret God's teachings, Leslie dug herself in an even bigger hole by linking to a Slate article attacking the reaction to the terror attack by Republicans
Leslie capped off her tirade in a fourth post decrying Muslims as œnot our enemy, any more than Christians or Jews or Hindus are before concluding that, instead, we should concern ourselves with œ[c]razy MFers with guns and mental issues.
œSo let's keep that sorted out, okay, she demanded.
Like many folks, I've got plenty of gratitude for the most important meal I'll eat this month. Sweet potatoes, stuffing, pecan pie My mouth is already watering just thinking about it. But the real centerpiece is the turkey, which “ thanks to Norman Rockwell “ evokes feelings of homecoming, family, and love.
Yet when I look at the turkey on my family's table this year, it will evoke a very different emotion: terror.
Unless your turkey came of age on an organic farm, there's a good chance it was pumped full of antibiotics. The overuse “ and misuse “ of these life-saving drugs on factory-farmed animals is making them less effective for humans.
In fact, at least 70 percent of the medically important antibiotics sold in the United States are wholesaled for use on poultry, cattle, and hog farms.
Factory farming crams thousands to tens of thousands of animals into tiny confined spaces, which can lead to disease outbreaks that threaten the industry's bottom line. As a precautionary measure, factory farmers add antibiotics to farm feed and apply them in huge volumes to animals that aren't sick.
This steady diet of anti-bacterial drugs breeds antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the animals' guts. Those bugs wind up in their excrement, which can filter into our food, air, and water “ exposing humans.
The terrifying part is that these drug-resistant bacteria render our usual remedies ineffective. Infections that were once easily treatable can become deadly when our drugs stop working. And hospitals are reporting large increases in antibiotic-resistant infections.
In Maryland, where I work, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have found an increase in infections on the Eastern Shore, where most of our large chicken farms are located. Unsurprisingly, research also shows a much higher rate of antibiotic resistance in farmworkers, who are in close contact with these animals.
Other countries, including Denmark, have phased out antibiotic abuse for their livestock without jeopardizing productivity. Here at home, some states are following their lead.
California just passed landmark legislation curtailing the practice. States like Maryland and Oregon are considering measures that would go even further to protect public health.
More than once around this time of year, I've counted myself thankful for effective antibiotics. When I got a throat infection that left me bedridden a few years ago, I could rely on penicillin to help me recover. And when I suffered from a particularly nasty case of gastroenteritis last year, one round of antibiotics cured all my symptoms.
The next time I contract a bacterial infection, will I be so lucky? Will you?
Now, as the House begins to hone details of its legislative proposal, a possible compromise has emerged. It would temporarily keep federal dollars flowing to cover almost the entire cost of the roughly 11 million Americans who have gained Medicaid coverage but would block that enhanced funding for any new participants.
At the same time, the GOP approach would open a fresh spigot of aid for the states   all but one of which has a Republican governor   that eschewed the additional Medicaid money because of their elected officials' antipathy to the law. This extra aid would probably go to hospitals with a large share of poor and uninsured patients.
The Solomon-like strategy is an attempt to calm fears of Republican governors in expansion states that abolishing the 2010 law would cost them hugely, while also satisfying new demands for equity from other GOP governors who opposed the expansion. Â­Details of how the plan's dual elements would be implemented, including their specific time frames and funding totals, are still coming together in the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
Within the context of the GOP's broader repeal effort   and this week's tumultuous town hall meetings around the country, at which lawmakers have been confronted by constituents scared of losing their health coverage   Republicans' ideas for Medicaid's future have drawn less public attention. Yet their proposals would significantly remake one of the nation's largest entitlement programs, which serves more than 74 million lower-income Americans and accounts for half the additions to the insurance rolls that the ACA has brought about.

A similar approach is under consideration in the Senate. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who is working toward a compromise to protect the roughly 700,000 Ohioans with Medicaid coverage Â­under the ACA, said he is open to either a temporary extension or another way to subsidize their health insurance. œIt's necessary to figure out how to provide coverage, and that's going to cost money, he said Thursday.
The House committee also is moving forward with a plan to convert the rest of Medicaid to a system in which states would get a fixed sum of federal money for every resident who is enrolled. Such per capita funding, outlined by the chamber's Republican leaders earlier this month, would be more restrictive than the way Medicaid has functioned since its birth as part of the Great Society legislation of the 1960s.
However, the allotments would be less rigid than block grants, which have been advocated for years by many conservatives and decried by liberals for their potential to reduce spending over time, prompting states to cut benefits or eligibility, or both. (Block grants might still emerge from Congress as an alternative that states could choose.)
This picture of the House's Â­behind-the-scenes work is based on interviews with several people familiar with the thinking of the Republican leadership. All spoke on the condition of anonymity since no plans have been announced.
[Medicaid exposes rifts within the GOP when it comes to replacing the ACA]
The deliberations on Medicaid expansion are further along than other components of the lawÂ­makers' thinking about how to shift government health policies in a more conservative direction, according to these individuals. The basic outline emerging from the Energy and Commerce Committee would œgrandfather in the adults currently on Medicaid-Â­ expansion rolls in 31 states and the District of Columbia. Still to be decided is whether the extra dollars for their coverage would last a specific length of time or continue as long as a beneficiary remained eligible.
As for non-expansion states, the extra money they would Â­receive might come through an increase in œdisproportionate share payments the federal government has long given hospitals that treat a lot of poor patients. Or the government could increase its payments for Medicaid's very poorest patients   a boost to Republican-led states across the South with large low-income populations.
The only Democratic-led state that has not expanded its MediÂ­caid program is Virginia, where Gov. Terry McAuliffe has been unable to overcome the resistance of the GOP-controlled legislature.
It's unclear whether the plan would accomplish its goal of satisfying a range of the 35 GOP governors now in office, no matter the stance each has taken on expansion.
Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who chairs the Republican Governors association, said at an event at The Washington Post on Friday that GOP governors are working closely with both lawmakers and the administration to determine how to transition those living above the poverty line off the expanded Medicaid rolls.
œMaybe I'm foolish, but I thought Medicaid is for people living in poverty, Walker said.
But Gov. John Kasich (R-Ohio), who discussed health-care reform Friday with President Trump in the Oval Office, said in an interview that he considered the current compromise inadequate.
œI don't think that paying hospitals for uncompensated care results with a healthier population, he said, adding that expansion has provided resources for those struggling with addiction and mental illness. œWhere are they supposed to go?
The House Ways and Means Committee is doing parallel work on overall ACA replacement. But according to the several people familiar with the House leadership's approach, a central idea under consideration there   new health-care tax credits   hit a snag this week when congressional budget ****ysts reported privately to the committee that the credits would cost the government a lot of money and would enable relatively few additional Americans to get insurance.
Those tax credits would replace subsidies the ACA provides people with incomes of up to 400 percent of the poverty level to help them afford health plans through marketplaces created under the law. The credits would be available to everyone who buys coverage on their own, wealthy or poor. But the Congressional Budget Office has concluded that the credits, as conceived at the moment, would be too small to help low-income people afford health plans. They also wouldn't make much difference to affluent people, according to the CBO, since most of them already are insured.
Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), an influential member of the Budget and Appropriations committees, said that while CBO models are not precise indicators of a bill's actual fiscal impact, the new estimate should remind Republicans that they œshould err on the side of being cautious, rather than make grandiose claims.
Democrats fell into that trap when passing the ACA, he said. œWe should not be overselling.
[Pence: ˜America's Obamacare nightmare is about to end']
When the ACA passed a polarized Congress in 2010, the idea was that about half the Americans who would gain health coverage would do so through the law's insurance marketplaces. The other half would come through MediÂ­caid, which was to grow nationwide to include adults earning up to 138 percent of the poverty level. The federal government would pay the full cost of expanded coverage for the first three years, then a decreasing amount before settling at 90 percent by 2020.
In 2012, though, in a case brought by ACA critics who unsuccessfully challenged the law's constitutionality, the Supreme Court ruled that each state had the latitude to choose whether to expand Medicaid. Nearly all Â­Democratic-led states said yes; most with Republican governors opted out.
The latest polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation, released Friday morning, shows that MediÂ­caid expansion enjoys strong public support. Nationally, 84 percent of respondents   and 87 percent in the 16 expansion states with GOP governors   said it is important to preserve the greater federal funding provided by the ACA.

œAbout $50 billion of projects have been defined and sent to President (Hassan Rouhani) for presentation to domestic and foreign investors amid hopes they will generate good dynamism in this sector, the minister said on Monday.
His ministry has drafted more than 800 national projects which are expected to take about 20 years to complete, the IRNA news agency quoted Chitchian as saying.
œWe are going to give over many of the projects to the private sector in order to carry them out at lower costs and in a shorter time, he added.
Iran used to give out heavy energy subsidies to its citizens but a half-hearted phasing out of those grants has left the water and power industry saddled with a massive debt.
Under the targeted subsidy program launched by former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, water and electricity prices were to be made œrealistic by March 2016 in order to encourage investments in the sector.
œA sharp decline in investments is the biggest loss which the energy industry is suffering from the improper implementation of the targeted subsidy law, Chitchian said.
œGiven that water and electricity prices are enormously lower than their real rates, the industry has built up a massive debt and lost ability to clear its dues.
Energy Minister Hamid Chitchian says more than 800 water and power generation projects have been defined for execution.
Iran is faced with a serious drought which is straining the country's water resources and power generation capacities.
Record temperatures have compounded the problem, causing electricity consumption to peak and putting the country at the brink of widespread blackouts and brownouts.
œForecasts suggest we have put behind the peak electricity load for the year 1394 which ends on March 20, 2016, meaning there will be no widespread outages, Chitchian said.
Iran's nominal power generation capacity stands at about 74,000 megawatts. The country will add another 2,000 megawatts to its national grid next year amid efforts to cope up with a runaway demand, the minister said.
Gas-powered plants produce the bulk of the electricity which the country consumes in the face of declining hydropower capacities due to the lingering drought.
Iran, instead, plans to ramp up solar and wind energy production, with a vision to generate 5,000 megawatts by 2020.
Why Georgia Tech? The Yellow Jackets don't have a great football history, though they do have that 1990 National Championship where they (Rambling) Wrecked the Huskers 45-21 in the Florida Citrus Bowl. All-time, Georgia Tech is 689-461-13 in football. So it's a decent football add. But what really makes Georgia Tech compelling for the Big Ten is staking out a firm placeholder in the Deep South. Otherwise known as SEC country. Tomorrow, the SEC Championship game will be held just over a mile away from Bobby Dodd Stadium on the Georgia Tech campus.
What does this mean for the Big Ten? For starters, television money from the eighth largest television market. More importantly, the Big Ten will now play games deep in the south. When players in the south are considering Big Ten schools, they can now point to games against Georgia Tech as an opportunity to play a game closer to home. At 993 miles between Memorial Stadium and Dodd Stadium, it's actually closer than Maryland and Rutgers for Husker fans.
If Georgia Tech becomes team #15, who becomes the 16th team? David Ubben of ESPN points out that the Big XII schools have all committed all of their media rights to the Big XII Conference...even if they leave. So barring the complete demise of the conference by mutual agreement, you can pretty much count out Kansas, Oklahoma, or Texas. So a 16th member will likely come from the ACC or Big East.
Notre Dame will probably get one last approach, and will be reminded that the ACC they thought they were joining is gone. The SEC will almost assuredly add two more schools, likely also from the ACC. If Notre Dame can't be swayed, the Big Ten will strike again. North Carolina? That would be my preference, but they might not leap unless Duke comes along. And then we're at 17... Virginia has been long rumored, and probably makes the most sense
Frank the Tank, who's been solid all along on conference realignment, offers up this curve ball.
If we're going to buy Big Ten Armageddon rumors (and I'm not an Armageddon guy), don't ignore Miami if you want a pair with Georgia Tech.   Frank the Tank (@frankthetank111) November 30, 2012
That's another game changer. Yes, the Hurricanes are always an NCAA violation just waiting to be investigated...but again, it expands the B1G footprint all over the eastern seaboard. Personally, I like this if only for the rivalry game where the U has to travel to Lincoln for a conference game in November.
Boston College or UConn also would be logical, if not unspectacular, additions to the conference and it's footprint. I kind of think that with Rutgers and the collapse of the ACC, the Big Ten will probably do fairly well in the northeast from a mindset perspective. I don't know that Jim Delaney needs to add a school there to reinforce that. But it's certainly an option.
A breakdown of the underlying data via Bloomberg
For the first quarter of 2016, real GDP is now estimated to have increased 0.8 percent; in the previously published estimates, first-quarter GDP was estimated to have increased 1.1 percent. The 0.3-percentage point downward revision to the percent change in first-quarter real GDP primarily reflected downward revisions to residential fixed investment, to private inventory investment, and to exports that were partly offset by upward revisions to nonresidential fixed investment, to PCE, to state and local government spending, to imports, and to federal government spending.
Just as bad, strong historical GDP reports such as the 3.9% alleged growth in Q2 2015 which served as the springboard for the Fed's rate hike rhetoric in mid-2015, was slashed to a far lower 2.6%.
As of this moment, the economy has grown at less than a 2% pace for three straight quarters. Since the recession ended seven years ago, the expansion has failed to achieve the breakout seen in past recoveries. The average annual growth rate during the current business cycle remains the weakest of any expansion since at least 1949.
The reason for the dramatic cuts: historical revisions going back to Q1 2013. From the BEA
Updated estimates of the national income and product accounts (NIPAs), which are usually made each July, incorporate newly available and more comprehensive source data, as well as improved estimation methodologies. This year, the notable revisions primarily reflect the incorporation of newly available and revised source data. The timespan of the revisions is the first quarter of 2013 through the first quarter of 2016. The reference year remains 2009.
It now appears that at a time when the US economy was said to be approaching escape velocity for a rate hike, it was in fact contracting. According to the latest data, in Q4 when Yellen announced the Fed's first rate hike, the growth trend economy was in fact decelerating, growing by only 0.9%, the lowest since Q1 2014.
Some more details
Core PCE 1.7%, far below Q1's downward revised 2.1%
GDP deflator: 2.2%, Exp. 1.8%, and up from 0.5%
From the BEA
Real gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 1.2 percent in the second quarter of 2016 (table 1), according to the "advance" estimate released by the Bureau of Economic ****ysis. In the first quarter, real GDP increased 0.8 percent (revised). The increase in real GDP in the second quarter reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and exports that were partly offset by negative contributions from private inventory investment, nonresidential fixed investment, residential fixed investment, and state and local government spending. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, decreased. The acceleration in real GDP growth in the second quarter reflected an acceleration in PCE, an upturn in exports, and smaller decreases in nonresidential fixed investment and in federal government spending. These were partly offset by a larger decrease in private inventory investment, and downturns in residential fixed investment and in state and local government spending.
There was some good news in the report: In the second quarter, consumer spending rose strongly. Personal consumption, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic output, expanded at a 4.2% rate, the best gain since late 2014. Outlays on goods advanced 6.8%. Spending on services climbed 3%. As part of the revision, a major adjustment was the contribution from Housing and utilities, which in Q2 supposedly added $43 billion to Personal Consumption, while Healthcare, traditionally the best performing category, only added $28.4 bilion. We are confident this number will be revised shortly again.
However, nonresidential fixed investment, a measure of business spending, declined at a 2.2% pace, the third straight quarterly drop. Companies spent less on buildings and equipment.
It appears capex matters.
Weak business investment is confirmation that firms don't have confidence in the global economy. Manufacturers especially have been challenged by a strong dollar, which makes U.S.-made goods more expensive overseas. The energy industry has also been constrained with relatively low oil and natural gas prices curtailing investments in mining and wells.
Firms also paired back inventories sharply. The change in private inventories subtracted 1.16 percentage points from overall growth. That was the category's fifth-straight decline and the largest drag from inventories in two years.
In the past year there have been four bank failures.
And the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and banking industry experts foresee many bank failures down the road.
"Regulators are bracing for 100-200 bank failures over the next 12-24 months," says Jaret Seiberg, an ****yst with the financial services firm, the Stanford Group.
Expected loan losses, the deteriorating housing market and the credit squeeze are blamed for the drop in bank profits.
The problem areas will be concentrated in the Rust Belt, in places like Ohio and Michigan and other states like California, Florida and Georgia.
The number of institutions categorized as "problem" institutions by the FDIC has also grown from 50 at the end of 2006 to 76 at the end of last year.
But to put that in perspective -- by the end of 1992 -- at the tail end of the banking crisis -- there were 1,063 banks on that "trouble" list says David Barr of the FDIC.

Banking experts say there is one thing that will save your money if your bank goes under. That's FDIC insurance. "It's the gold standard," says banking consultant Bert Ely. "The FDIC has ample resources. It's never been an issue," he says.
The FDIC insures deposits in banks and thrift institutions. The federal agency was created during the Great Depression in response to thousands of bank failures. The FDIC maintains that not one depositor has lost a single cent of insured funds since 1934 as a result of a bank failure
Experts say you shouldn't panic.
"The banking industry comes into this in a very sound condition," says Ely.
Seiberg agrees. "This is not a repeat of the S&L debacle of the late '80s and early '90s. Banks are entering this credit cycle with better capital and better earnings. Many more of them can weather the storms ahead," he says.
And there could be a silver lining. Banks looking for cash may offer some of the best short-term CD rates. "It's a cheap way for banks to make money," says Greg McBride of Bankrate.com.
Protecting your money
Here's how to make sure you pick a safe bank. First, look for the FDIC logo at your local branch. If you don't see it, ask the bank, or go to the FDIC's Web site and click on "Bank Find." Here you'll be able to see if the bank carries this guarantee.
This step is especially important if you're using an Internet-only bank or a bank you've never heard of. You can also check out the financial health of a banking institution at www.bankrate.com.
The FDIC also maintains a list of bank rating agencies on its Web site that can assess a banks financial stability. But in many cases, these companies charge a fee.
As loan delinquencies rise, and bank failures increase, the FDIC is shoring up its reserves. The agency is bringing back formerly retired employees to bolster a division that deals specifically with bank failures. Many of these agency veterans worked for the FDIC during the late 1980s and early 1990s, when thousands of financial institutions failed during the savings-and-loan crisis according to Barr..
Know your limits
As an individual, your deposits are insured up to $100,000 in an FDIC-insured bank. This includes your savings, your checking, any certificate of deposits (CDs) and money market accounts. Joint accounts can be insured up to $200,000.
IRAs and Keoghs -- these are retirement plans for people who are self-employed -- can be insured up to $250,000. These retirement accounts are considered separate from your individual bank accounts.
If you have money in a credit union, the same protections exist. However, instead of the FDIC insurance, deposits are insured under the National Credit Union Administration, another government agency.
Of course, banks offer much more than your bread-and-butter savings and checking accounts. Some offer investments such as mutual funds or stock funds, which generally promise higher rates of return than CDs, are not insured by the FDIC nor are they insured by the broker/dealer. The general rule is deposits are FDIC-guaranteed, but not investments.
And keep in mind, annuities, life insurance policies -- even the contents of your safe-deposit box -- are not insured. If you're worried you don't have enough insurance on your accounts, the FDIC Web site has a tool that will allow you to calculate your insurance coverage. It's called the electronic deposit insurance estimator -- or EDIE for short. You can also call the agency at 877-ASK-FDIC.
And rest assured if you have U.S. savings bonds or treasury bills, the principle and interest on these products are backed by the faith and credit of the federal government so there's no risk of default as long as you don't sell these products before they mature says McBride.
If your bank bites the dust, there's nothing to fear according to the FDIC. A healthier banking institution normally buys the failed bank according to Barr. "There is little or no interruption to the consumer," he says. "If you go to bed one night as a customer of a bank, and you wake up as a customer of a new bank, there is nothing you have to do." Your checks will still clear, you can still use your ATM card.
But, there can be changes to the terms of your original deposit. For example, if you took out a CD with an annual percentage rate of 3.5 percent, it's entirely possible the new bank will drop that interest rate. If that happens, you have the option to withdraw your funds without penalty.
Loans are handled differently. If you took out a loan with a bank, for example an auto loan or a mortgage, those interest rates and terms of interest remain the same regardless of the new bank.
Astronomers figure it wasn't always like that, though. While Venus now has very little water in its atmosphere, it could have had oceans as deep as 525 meters (1,700 feet) billions of years ago. The atmosphere was likely far less thick and toxic, too. The Goddard team plugged all of those factors into climate models used for Earth, and they showed that it had a mean surface air temperature of 11 degrees C (52 degrees F), with max temperatures at 95 degrees F. That means that several billion years ago it could have been just as likely to support life as Earth, if not more so.
The surface of Venus in false color (NASA/JPL)
There are a lot of "ifs," though. The simulation depends on the rotational period and topography of Venus being about the same as they are today. Venus currently takes a ridiculous 243 Earth days to spin once on its own axis (longer than its 225-day year), but planets often spin faster when they're younger. When the simulation was re-run with a much faster rotational period of 16 Earth days, average temperatures were nearly five times hotter -- 133 degrees F, maxing at an inhospitable 183 degrees F. Changing the landscape to be more Earth-like, meanwhile, yielded temperatures warmer by 18 degrees F, which is also borderline for life.
The new models don't prove that Venus was once habitable, but they do show that it could have been. That knowledge may allow astronomers to reconsider exoplanet habitable zones by taking rotation into account. It also provides another theory for how life got on Earth. Scientists already think that meteor impacts spread materials between Mars and our planet, possibly seeding life. If Venus harbored life billions of years ago, it might have done so, too.
In the 19th century, baseball evolved from an amateur, club-based sport to a highly organized entertainment business considered a national pastime. The collection of studio portraits, photographs, and drawings maintained by A.G. Spalding and held at the New York Public Library charts this progression.
A former pitcher, team president, and entrepreneur, Spalding was a major force behind the professionalization and commercialization of baseball. œWe have this idea that the game has always been the same, that it's written in stone, but the fact is it's changed a whole lot, said Warren Goldstein, author of Playing for Keeps: A History of Early Baseball.
From the number of balls it took to walk a batter to the distance between the pitcher's mound and home plate, baseball was a very different sport in its early days. There were fewer umpires, which meant that players often stole across the field from first base to third while no one was paying attention. Gambling was rampant. Safety measures were virtually nonexistent: Fielders didn't wear gloves, batters didn't wear helmets, and catchers didn't wear masks. Spectators frequently fired pistols into the air to distract fielders trying to catch balls.
Early uniforms were made of heavy flannel and modeled off of those worn by volunteer firemen of the 1850s and 1860s. Before the wallet-sized baseball cards that eventually became popular, images of players were reproduced on cabinet cards and cartes de visite in the style of the day's celebrity portraiture. œYou get some funny instances, these baseball players essentially before a backdrop of a Victorian garden, the sort of humorous fakery of a ball suspended on a string, said David Lowe, a photography specialist at the New York Public Library.

Baseball players' bodies were also very different from the bodies of players today. Although many were quite strong, they mostly looked like ordinary people. œWhile baseball is a hard game to play, most people were not under the impression that baseball players were athletes, Goldstein said. œBaseball players didn't go to the gym.
They also didn't make much money. According to Goldstein, an average player on a professional team in 1869 earned about as much as a craftsman (though in half the time). Many players picked up other work in the off-season to make ends meet.
By the late 19th century, Goldstein said, baseball started to look like the game as we know it now. And although the game bears many similarities to its 19th-century ancestor, a lot has changed. œWhile a fan from 1905 would certainly recognize the game, now if he saw an umpire warning a pitcher who'd thrown a high and inside pitch, he'd laugh his head off, Goldstein said.
Some of the photographs in Spalding's collection are on display through March 16 in the exhibition œPlay Things at the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building at the New York Public Library. The image collection is also available online through the library's website.

But Mr. Qayoumi, who leads San Jose State University, is referring to the retail giant's ability to continually expand both its brick-and-mortar stores and its online services. "It has the biggest stores all over the country, but it is also really active in e-commerce," he says. "It's not an either/or, it's an issue of how we can really bring a blend of the two together."
Mr. Qayoumi is trying a similar blending on his campus. He is experimenting with using massive open online courses, or MOOCs, both to bring down the cost of delivering classes on his campus and to let high-school students and others get a head start on college on the cheap.
THE INNOVATOR: Mohammad H. Qayoumi, San Jose State U. THE BIG IDEA: Colleges can borrow strategies from business to help students move through more quickly and cheaply.
For his first goal of cutting costs, the university teamed up with edX, the nonprofit MOOC provider started by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to offer a "circuits and electronics" course in which students watched free lectures made by MIT professors as homework and attended class discussions with instructors at San Jose State.
The experiment violated a basic premise of college teaching that every professor should create and deliver his or her own lectures.
"How different is the basic algebra course taught in Boston, or California, or wherever?" asks Mr. Qayoumi.
To help provide a cheaper online-only option, the university forged a partnership with Udacity, a for-profit MOOC provider. In a pilot project, the company worked with professors at the university to create three introductory mathematics classes. The courses are free online, but students who want credit from San Jose State can take them for just $150, far less than the $450 to $750 that students would typically pay for a credit-bearing course.
Both moves are part of Mr. Qayoumi's plan to "reinvent" public universities. He has laid out that vision in a series of reports that call for public colleges to use technology to produce more graduates while spending less money. In one, he suggests that some high-school students might take a year's worth of courses as MOOCs before even coming to a college campus.

Some professors question the president's notion that colleges should look to industry for inspiration. "It almost treats students like they're industrial products, like 'How many widgets can we get through those programs?'" said David Parry, an assistant professor of emerging media at the University of Texas at Dallas, in an interview this year after San Jose State announced its project with Udacity.
Mr. Qayoumi, though, sees the move to online learning as a way to actually improve the quality of education. In large lecture classes, he says, people romanticize the classroom experience and overstate the effectiveness of the chalk-and-talk format. When professors give monologues to a room of 120 students, few actually interact with the sage on the stage.
So far, data are proving him right. In his experiment with the edX circuits class, 91 percent of the students who watched the lecture videos from MIT passed, while only 55 percent and 59 percent passed in the two traditional sections offered as control groups.
The president compares higher education today to the railroad industry in the 1940s and 50s: Companies that stubbornly clung to the view that they were in the railroad business failed, while those that diversified, considering their mission as transportation in whatever form, thrived.
"How can we really help our students be successful?" he asks. "How can we be this cradle of creativity and an intellectual center of new ideas and new knowledge?"
"We are a learning enterprise," he says. And he's willing to abandon the old rails of traditional instruction.
Mr. Qayoumi, 60, grew up in Afghanistan and trained as an engineer at the American University of Beirut. He did his doctoral thesis at the University of Cincinnati on how to rethink electrical systems to make them more efficient.
He worked in industry for several years as an engineer in the Middle East which he credits for giving him his business-minded approach to college leadership.
In the mid-80s he became associate vice president for administration at San Jose State, and held administrative positions at two other California institutions before becoming president of California State University-East Bay, in 2006. He took over the top job at San Jose State two years ago.
He has also played a role in the rebuilding of his homeland, serving as senior adviser to the minister of finance of Afghanistan, from 2002 to 2005, and as a board member of the Central Bank of Afghanistan, from 2003 to 2006.
His reports and his experiments with MOOCs have recently brought him into the national spotlight. He has presented his ideas to Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, and Gov. Jerry Brown of California has taken an interest in his projects.
Mr. Qayoumi often talks as if he's running a start-up technology company rather than a state university. "We would like to move as fast as we can," he says of his plans. "We want to fail fast, learn from it, and move on."
What would he say to someone who worries that too much fast failing could undo his esteemed university?
"I don't see them as radical," he says of his projects. "It's not that we're changing the entire university."
The first thing is that American soccer collectively wondered who this guy is.
Etim is listed as a midfielder on the MLS Players Union release, not necessarily a stone-cold indication of his position, but a start.
He's a product of the vaunted Montverde Academy in Montverde, Fla. Located in Central Florida, the school is well known as a prep school for athletes in several sports, and in recent years several soccer players have gone from the school to sign a professional contract, including San Jose Earthquakes midfielder Matheus Silva, Vancouver Whitecaps midfielder Deybi Flores, defender Oumar Diakhite, who now plays professionally in Portugal, and several members of the nearby Orlando City and Orlando City B teams.
Etim played for Montverde as recently as January, helping his school win a tournament they sponsored against teams from around the United States and abroad, and scored the lone goal in a win over Dutch powerhouse Feyenoord.
So it appears Etim is a rookie, although I have not been able to find his exact age.
What about 2017? If Etim is under contract at LAFC and they aren't playing until next year, then what will he do?
Based on his Instagram page, Etim is apparently an Orange County SC player. This is bolstered by this post from earlier in the month, apparently taken in the company of other OCSC players.
On behalf of my teammates@Orange County Soccer Club and I, we wish you all a happy Easter A post shared by monday bassey etim (@etimmondaybassey) on Apr 16, 2017 at 9:29am PDT
While Etim says he's an Orange County player, it should be noted that Orange County SC has not announced his signing (which would presumably be a loan from LAFC, like Alvarez), he's not listed on Orange County SC's website, or on USL's website. Orange County SC had not responded to a request for comment on Etim as of Tuesday at 5:20 pm PT.
So what does this all tell us? Etim will probably be announced as an Orange County SC player at some point. There may be some delay on paperwork that has slowed down an announcement, but it seems quite likely one is on the horizon.
As for the veracity of the LAFC link, that is basically set in stone. The MLS Players Union would not include a player only rumored to be signed. All players under MLS contract are included in their salary release, and if he's in the salary info, then he's definitely under contract.
So what does this mean for the future? Is Etim guaranteed an MLS roster spot with LAFC in 2018? Not necessarily. Much like Alvarez, signing an MLS contract a year early certainly indicates a substantial interest by the expansion team and an expectation that the player will likely be in the team's plans to begin the 2018 season. It does not, however, necessarily mean he's a lock to make the LAFC roster for 2018, or if he does, that he'll definitely get playing time. He might, but it's much better to think of this year as an extended trial for next year, with the security of drawing a salary in the meantime.
I expect we'll learn more about Etim in the days, weeks, and months to follow. From his apparent youth and likely rookie status, he's another prospect, one with a solid pedigree. He remains a mystery on several levels, but we're starting to get a sense of who the newest LAFC player is.
From high-tech workstations to near-silent setups, here are the top 7 trends from Orgatec 2016.
Versatility breeds collaboration
It's a message that has been growing louder and louder over the past few years: no two workers are the same. As the creative individualism of employees is increasingly celebrated, employers are seeing a need for workstations that adapt and react to their various needs and uses. Haworth, for example, showcased the Immense series of tables, calling it a œmicrocosm of collaborative space with various heights and arrangements to suit meetings, collaborative projects, and independent work. œCreating a landscape of varied surfaces to support the temporality of meetings, the Immerse table enables work by offering a micro atmosphere that can support groups or the individual; standing or sitting, says Haworth.
Meetings are getting shorter and are taking place standing up
It's no secret that formal meetings waste time and energy. With an estimated $37 billion lost per year in the U.S. to unproductive meetings, employers are keen on making meetings shorter and more relevant. Products like Ongo's Meet & Swing aim to help with this change: the system includes a skinny standing-height table and œstanding supports “ aka leaning chairs “ that encourage more movement. œIt brings a touch of freedom to the office and inspired informal exchanges between colleagues, says the German company in its press material. œIt is precisely this that often leads to the good ideas that are indispensable in this day and age.
Temperature is (finally) becoming employee-controlled
Granted, it's hard to keep everyone happy when it comes to the office temperature. But there's no shortage of research (like this survey and this article) showing how temperature can impact productivity and concentration. Enter German manufacturer KlÃ¶ber with an inspired solution: Mera Klimastuhl, a desk chair with integrated heating and air conditioning. The customizable chair has a 16-hour rechargeable battery that runs the heating and ventilation through the back and seat.
Standing isn't for everyone
Sitting might be the new smoking, but stand-up workstations don't work for all workers. With that in mind, œhealthy sitting products are on the rise to help older demographics and other workers that can't benefit from standing desks. There was a wide range of offerings from exhibitors at Orgatec, including Vitra's chair that automatically responds to movement and Actiu's seat designed specifically for millennials. A standout, however, was Kinema's latest iteration of its Active Chair, which offers settings for traditional, elevated, and standing sitting. œThere is no one ideal posture for desk jockeys, says Kinema. œBut there is a healthy solution “ a well-balanced combination of standing and sitting, a so-called Stand-Sit-Support-Dynamic.œ
The office is getting (more) wireless
œEmployees, executives and academics no longer work from traditional offices, says wireless charging technology company Zens. œAs location-independent workers, they enjoy personalized digital services in every environment. In short: workers don't want to cart charging cables all over the office. At Orgatec, Zens teamed up with office furniture company Sedus to launch workstations integrated with cordless charging points and Qi technology to keep phones, tablets, and laptops charged just by placing them on the worktop.
In open plan spaces, silence is golden
As offices continue to embrace the open-plan set-up, finding solutions to reduce background noise is a constant struggle. œHardly any other aspect of modern workplaces is as hotly discussed as the optimisation of the room acoustics, says Orgatec's trends material. œPrinting, telephoning, discussing “ even slight background noise can disturb people from concentrating on their work. At the show, several companies paired acoustic insulation with visual partitions. Thonet's Canor, for example, does triple duty as a sound dampener, a space delineator, and a bulletin board.
and personal space is at a premium
Another issue surrounding open-plan offices is the lack of space for employees to make a call “ or just take a breather. Sound-proof telephone booths amid the bustle aren't brand new, but companies are taking it a step further with mini office spaces that employees can slip into for longer periods. The Micro Office by Czech company SilentLab is a freestanding œprivate spot complete with LEDs, a desk with drawer, soft seating, and various tech hook-ups.
But she also left her musicians and backstage staff gagging over the fumes from her never-ending flatulence.
One member of her crew at the *** Pride rally revealed: œThe smell was foul, like a dumpster full of rotting food. And some of her farts were loud, so there was no pretending she wasn't the source of the stench.
œIt was especially bad every time she bent over to change costume or made a vigorous move on stage. A fresh one would come cracking out but she'd just laugh when people held their noses.
Gassy Gaga, 27, blames a new diet that has helped her lose 2st 1lb since her surgery.
But a source close “ but not too close “ to the Born This Way singer confided: œThe real problem is she has been trying to crash diet by making modifications to the one her nutritionist and trainer devised for her.
Any discussion about a U.S.-led military intervention into Syria's civil war should begin with the articulation of what the United States intends to achieve strategically. The Obama administration has offered a wide range of objectives, including strengthening the opposition and its defense capabilities, marginalizing extremists within it and compelling its various elements to unify and participate in negotiations with President Bashar al-assad's regime. The administration says it wants to prevent the large-scale use or movement of chemical weapons, preserve state institutions, and, as President Obama stated in June, help to ensure a Syria "that is peaceful, non-sectarian, democratic, legitimate, tolerant."
An attack will aid the opposition, not just suppress the use of chemical weapons. So it will likely turn into a campaign to topple assad.
What is unclear, based on information that administration officials have leaked to journalists, is which of these half-dozen objectives the White House believes can be accomplished with a limited, stand-off military force against military assets controlled by President Bashar al-assad's regime. Based on early reporting, it appears that the only objective of the potential use of force would be to prevent the further use of chemical weapons by the assad regime.
Therefore, the practical impact of the intervention would not be to protect civilians on the ground from state-directed violence, but to deter assad from using one type of indiscriminate lethality, chemical weapons. If Obama decides that achieving this outcome is in the U.S. national interests - both in terms of Syria and any deterrent effect it has on the potential use of chemical weapons users elsewhere - then he will likely authorize the reported cruise missile and airstrikes.
However, it is highly unlikely that such an intervention can be so narrow that it will not force a deeper U.S. military engagement in Syria's civil war. Many have compared the potential upcoming use of force to the December 1998 United States and Great Britain attack against Iraq's suspected weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile capabilities. In that four-day bombing campaign, only one-third of the targets were related to the production of weapons of mass destruction or ballistic missile programs. Similarly, in the case of Syria, most of what the United States bombs would not be directly tied to assad's chemical weapon production, storage or weaponization facilities. Even a limited cruise missile strike will not be merely an attack on assad's chemical weapons capabilities, but an attack on the regime itself.
Subsequently, the United States will be correctly perceived by all sides as intervening on behalf of the armed opposition. From there, it is easy to conceive how the initial limited intervention for humanitarian purposes - like Libya in 2011 - turns into a joint campaign plan to assure that assad is toppled.
But now let's say you're a team that has perfected your entry scheme, and you find yourself setting up in formation at a consistent rate. What now? How can one maximize one's use of possession in formation to score goals at the highest possible rate?
Let's start by looking at this from another angle. What metric conceptually would be a good representation of whether a team is having success in formation? Well we would want time spent in formation to be the denominator, rather than simply overall 5-on-4 time. As for the numerator, would goal-scoring work (ie GF/60 formation mins)? It's possible, but the sample size will likely be pretty small as with any goal-based metric. Would shot attempt generation work (ie CF/60 formation mins)? That way we would have a larger sample size, but there's one problem. We like shot attempt numbers at even strength because they show that a team is getting into positions to shoot (driving the play in the right direction), and the same can even be said for overall power play numbers. But when a team is already set up in formation, players could shoot whenever they wanted. It may be that CF60 mins of formation time is predictive because players are smart, but registering a shot attempt certainly isn't an accomplishment in and of itself. But we'll get to that.
The happy medium here would seem to be scoring chances. If a team is getting scoring chances when set up in formation, that's a pretty good sign that they are doing a good job with that particular aspect of the man advantage. When we talk about scoring chances, we're normally referring to the home plate area (the inner and outer slot, basically, seen at left courtesy of Jewels From The Crown).
But we do that because of our lack of access to shot quality data. With the NHL's play-by-play data, we mostly only have access to shot location. This season, though, I've been sure to track other indicators of shot quality. Using a few characteristics that I have found to increase shooting percentage, I have developed a new form of scoring chances that I have termed High Quality Chances (HQC). To begin with we won't bother with whether or not the team is in formation. These will include all 5-on-4 shot attempts. High Quality Chances are composed of the following
Terms
CShPct = Goals/Shot Attempts
Pct Total Shots = Percentage of Total 5-on-4 shots tracked that fit this criteria
Pct Total Goals = Percentage of Total 5-on-4 goals tracked that fit this criteria
Home Plate Area Location Shots
CShPct: 9.00%, Pct Total Shots: 43.50%, Pct Total Goals: 68.10%
Home plate area chances are dangerous purely because of the proximity to the goaltender. Goalies have less time to react, and often have to retreat to give themselves time to slide across on a potential goal-mouth pass or deke, giving the shooter a better angle at the net. As seen above, Evgeny Kuznetsov provides the Washington Capitals with a dimension that even Nicklas Backstrom doesn't, the ability to cut in for a quick and dangerous wrist shot.
As you can see from the numbers above, teams get home plate area shots off quite frequently, and almost 70 percent of the goals you see at 5-on-4 are from the home plate area.
Royal Road One-Timers
CShPct: 13.90%, Pct Total Shots: 3.70%, Pct Total Goals: 14.90%
The royal road is an imaginary line that extends from the center of the goal up through the top of the faceoff circles, splitting the lower part of the offensive zone into two east-west halves. The concept was created by former NHL goaltender Steve Valiquette and the idea is that shots preceded by the puck crossing that center line will go in a higher percentage of the time. You can read all about the Royal Road, and more of that fascinating research which was one of the inspirations behind some of my own shot quality work, here.
One-timers that cross the royal road are usually also scoring chances, but as with the Alex Galchenyuk goal scored above, they aren't always. These shots are, however, dangerous because of forcing the goalie to move laterally a great distance at high speeds   one of the most difficult things for a goalie to do. While I have tried to keep each GIF representative of only one type of shot (no overlap), I would be remiss not to note that Brendan Gallagher provides an excellent pass screen prior to this goal. We usually think of screens as being purely on shots, but when it comes to one-timers, pass screens can be just as deadly. The goaltender here is unable to pick up on Galchenyuk's shot quick enough because he is blocked from tracking the puck as it leaves P.K. Subban's stick at the left point. Finally, since it's something I've stressed since day 1, note how this play would not have been possible if Subban and Galchenyuk weren't both playing their off-wings on the respective half-walls.
You can see from the numbers above that cross-ice one-timers aren't particularly common; it usually takes a defensive breakdown for one as clean as this to become available. But you can see from the shooting percentage that they are incredibly dangerous.
Screened Shots
CShPct: 4.50%, Pct Total Shots: 24.90%, Pct Total Goals: 21.30%
Unfortunately, I only started tracking screens halfway through the season, so all of the numbers you see here are for the second half. The non-screen components, though, have been double checked using data from the first half, and the numbers line up pretty closely
At even-strength, hockey people likely overstate the importance of screens, as very little of the game consists of teams set up in the offensive zone in areas where screens are executable. On the power play though, that situation is half the battle. As I discussed on last week's PDOCast, a team can allocate a minimally skilled net front player to fill that role on the power play, have that guy hardly touch the puck, and still have it as a net-positive. Because of the speed of the game and defense/offense split, something like that can't be accomplished at even strength. It's why players like Brian Boyle and Ryan White can be productive players on the power play, as long as they are put in a position to succeed and aren't asked to do too much. It is also, though, why having a player like Wayne Simmonds or Anders Lee or even Justin Abdelkader who can play the net front role but still contribute to other aspects of the power play is a huge benefit when up a man.
Screens are hugely important on the power play. They turn a wasted shot into a scoring chance without too much difficulty, which is a huge advantage. I like to think of it like a half-court offense in basketball. You play 4-on-4, and then your big man in the post is guarded by their big man, aka their goalie. If you don't have that guy there, though, you had better have a shooting threat like Alex Ovechkin/Steph Curry, because it's going to be easier for the opposition to close down on point shots, and of course easier for the goalie to stop them.
Tipped Shots
CShPct: 15.20%, Pct Total Shots: 4.30%, Pct Total Goals: 12.80%
Tipped shots are an extension of screened shots. If you get traffic in front of the net, you are hoping for the possibility that the puck gets tipped on goal, and if not are settling for the screen. In my criteria, I defined tip-pass plays as one-timers, so this category is purely shots that would have been on-goal anyway, forcing a last second adjustment by the goaltender. Anders Lee is one of the best at this skill, as seen above where he manages to tip a Nick Leddy shot into the net despite being tangled up with a Penguins defender in front.
Tipped shots aren't super common   tipping a shot with direction is one of the most difficult skills in the game   but they are deadly. It is the defenseman's job to either front the shot   block it before it reaches the screening player   or tie up that offensive player's stick so that the goalie gets a clean save opportunity.
Rebound Shots
CShPct: 12.20%, Pct Total Shots: 8.80%, Pct Total Goals: 19.10%
I am cheating a little bit including rebound shots in this definition. After all, you can't tell a team œwhen you're in formation just take rebound shots. But they are certainly high quality chances and account for a large portion of 5-on-4 goals. So if teams can't just take rebound shots, how can this knowledge be applied? Well, from past research, we know that certain types of shots produce more rebounds than others. Specifically, we know that screened and tipped shots produce more rebounds, and the data at least suggests that the same is probably true if to a lesser degree for general scoring chance and one-timer shots. Not-so-coincidentally, those are our other four High Quality Chance categories. So rebounds are the fifth and final category, but they are also contained within the other four categories. Take screened, tipped, home plate area and royal road one-timer shots, and the rebound goals as well as the initial goals, will come.
Here are all of those percentages displayed together
High Quality Chances For go in 7.22 percent of the time, compared to 0.76 percent of the time for non-High Quality (or œLow Quality Chances). That means that if you attempt 132 shots on the power play that aren't either from the home plate area, a Royal Road one-timer, a screened shot, a tipped shot, or a rebound, you will score on average on only one of them. Yeah.
As for High Quality Chances, as I pointed out in my presentation in Vancouver, they account for more than 95 percent of 5-on-4 goals among the teams I've tracked in the second half of the season. If we go back to the beginning of the season for a larger sample size and exclude screened shots (since I wasn't tracking them for the first half), that number is still 85 percent. Additionally, a large portion of the Low Quality Chances that went in were Alex Ovechin one-timers from just outside the faceoff circle. Remove those, and suddenly Low Quality Chances become Wasted Chances pretty quickly.
So we've established some of the bigger factors that influence shot quality on the power play, but now we need to know whether we can use High Quality Chances as a repeatable or predictive metric. Going back to our original question about formation time, I looked at three different metrics
Goals for per 60 minutes in formation
Shot attempts for per 60 minutes in formation
High quality chances for per 60 minutes in formation
As in last week's piece, I looked at on-ice data for every player that fit a minimum ice time threshold (each dot is a player) and assessed repeatability (is this an actionable skill) and predictive ability (can we use this to determine how good a power play will be in the future).
All three of these metrics show high repeatability, and they are very similar in terms of the extent to which they account for in-sample and out-sample goal scoring efficiency in formation. But the sample sizes are small, since we are only talking about half the season for five teams, and a quarter of the season for a sixth   in total approximately 100 goals.
Because it's a larger sample size, let's look at full season data. For the following plot, InForm HQCF60 doesn't include screened shots.
Now suddenly the results don't seem promising. Over the full season, none of these metrics predict out of sample goal scoring, and only shot attempt generation, despite the ease with which teams can get shots off in formation, is significantly repeatable.
The takeaway therefore is that more research needs to be done with more data. At this point, InForm HQCF60 is not a metric I would advise using to evaluate a power play. Still, it can be interesting to identify which teams and players have on-ice success at generating such chances. Here is the top and bottom 10 players I've tracked that met my threshold, starting with the full season.
The New York Islanders, despite having trouble with entries, do well once they finally do get set up. The Philadelphia Flyers' second unit the first half of the year did not perform well, as evidenced by this data. As for Alex Semin, it once again doesn't appear as though he was helping the Montreal Canadiens power play all that much. You can see the entire full-season rankings here.
Now what if we look at the best and worst on-ice performers in only the second half of the season, when we include screened shots.
Once again the Islanders look prolific, which is no surprise when you consider the importance of Anders Lee in front of the net for their first unit. When it comes to the Capitals' second half power play slump, as well as some entry difficulty, both of the team's units also weren't doing a very good getting off high quality shots (or really any shots) once set up. You can see the full list of half-season performers here.
Social media firms in Germany could face fines of up to 50 million euros if they take too long to remove illegal content including fake news.
Germany's justice minister has drafted a law that seeks to impose the fines as part of efforts to police toxic chat.
Heiko Maas said the voluntary efforts of social networks to tackle the problem had not gone far enough.
The proposal requires sites to run 24-hour helplines and to delete flagged content within seven days.
'Utterly impossible'
Social media firms such as Twitter and Facebook were getting better at handling illegal content, said Mr Maas, but both had a long way to go.
Mr Maas quoted research which suggested Twitter deletes only 1% of the hate speech it is told about by users, and Facebook, 39%.
"This isn't sufficient yet," said Mr Maas.
Racism and hate speech are believed to have become more prevalent on German social media following the arrival of large number of refugees in Germany.
Any content that was "clearly criminal" would have to be removed within 24 hours under conditions outlined in the draft law. If, after an investigation, content is found to be criminal then that must be removed in seven days. The people who posted the illegal content must also be told about its deletion.
The proposed law would require each network to run fully staffed, round-the-clock reporting systems and to name an individual responsible for handling complaints. That person could face an individually levied fine of five million euros if companies break laws governing what can be published.
Mr Maas said the law could apply to fake news articles if they proved to be slanderous, defamatory or libellous.
Facebook did not comment directly on the proposal but said tests it commissioned showed it removed a higher percentage of illegal content than Mr Maas claimed. The social network said it expected to have 700 people employed in Berlin by the end of 2017 overseeing its efforts to review flagged content.
Gripping the podium like it was Hoffman's neck, Daley informed the City Hall press corps that he and his administration, including chief of staff Paul Volpe, would never, ever enter into a contract that wasn't great for the city. "My chief of staff detailed detailed! why we think this is a very, very responsible agreement," Daley said. "As mayor it is my job to be responsible."
When reporters asked about Hoffman's suggestion endorsed by a growing number of aldermen that any future sale of a public asset be subjected to "independent ****ysis" before being finalized, Daley snapped that the city had commissioned outside experts to do just that, most notably the Chicago-based investment firm William Blair & Company. "This agreement had the best professional people with regard to this agreement," he said.
When asked why that company had been selected, as opposed to any of the dozens of other investment firms around the country, Daley became indignant: "Those are good people!"
This testy exchange with reporters turned the spotlight, if only for an instant, on one element of the parking meter agreement that's so far received very little attention: the battery of well-connected, highly paid financial and legal consultants who executed the deal on the city's behalf and who are immune from the regulations that govern most contractors doing business with the city.
In April the Reader published a cover story explaining how the deal went down: City officials worked on it for months, refusing to disclose to the public even basic information such as who had bid on the contract and how much. Then, two days after the first announcement about the agreement, and before aldermen had seen copies of it, the City Council voted to approve it. In May we published a second cover piece, revealing that the meters had been leased for a fraction of their actual worth. The taxpayers had been hosed. Why?
The implementation of the plan has been a mess: parking rates have doubled, mislabeled and malfunctioning meters have led to citations, and response from LAZ Parking, the firm contracted to run the system, has been less than acceptable. In the weeks since our first story was published, angry residents have been pelting their aldermen with complaints. The aldermen, in turn, have gotten outraged as well, ordering city lawyers to investigate whether the contract can be terminated and passing an ordinance requiring a 15-day waiting period before the sale of an asset can be approved. At the end of May a spokesman for Illinois attorney general Lisa Madigan announced that she had launched an investigation into the "transaction and implementation" of the parking meter deal. And then Hoffman, a mayoral appointee, released his scathing report, charging that the city had rushed into the "dubious" deal and estimating that it had handed off the meters for barely half their value.
Daley and other top administration officials now say the meter agreement was the result of more than a year and a half of study, legal work, and competitive pricing. "The city conducted a robust, open, transparent, and competitive bid process," Volpe said, in a prepared response to Hoffman's report. William Blair had determined that the meters could fetch between $650 million and $1.2 billion on the open market, he said, and the winning bid was at the upper end of that range.
But the sad fact is that city officials have avoided openness and transparency almost every step of the way. And they don't appear to be changing their tune now, as we attempt to determine exactly how William Blair was chosen to evaluate the deal and what its role was in pulling the agreement together. One thing they've conceded, however, is that there was no bidding process for the job: they say Blair was deemed to have expertise that made it particularly suitable for this kind of work. But our latest investigation piecing together public documents, records of City Council hearings, interviews with elected officials and financial experts, company profiles, and previous news reports reveals that there's a lot more to the story
aNot only did William Blair advise the city on the deal it came up with the idea in the first place. Then it provided the city with the only estimate it ever received of what the system was worth and coordinated the bidding process.
aTwo other financial services firms and three law firms were brought in to assist. All were given no-bid contracts for the work, and all appear to have political or personal ties to the Daley administration (which is not unusual for the way the city of Chicago does business).
aThe financial advisers were each paid a share of what the city made in cash on the lease deal. William Blair received 0.375 percent of the payout, or about $4.3 million, according to records obtained from the city through a FOIA request. The others, Gardner Rich and Ramirez & Company, each received 0.0625 percent, or $722,813. The attorneys' fees added up to another $1.3 million. All told, the city paid its legal and financial advisers more than $7 million for their work on the deal.
aAt the same time they were helping the city prepare and conduct the bidding process for the parking meter lease, all of the financial firms, including William Blair, were working on other multibillion-dollar deals with the company that emerged as the winning bidder, Morgan Stanley. The overlapping relationships are in violation of the city's own contracting rules.
aPartners in two of the three law firms hired to work on the deal had previously donated money to Mayor Daley's campaign. City rules ban contributions to the mayor from employees of city contractors but don't apply to law firms.
aTogether the lawyers and financial advisers not anyone in city government determined who would control the parking meter system for the next several generations and how much money they'd make off it. But as private entities, none of these firms are required by law to disclose to the public how they arrived at their plan. And none would talk to us for this story.
Needless to say, it's standard operating procedure for the city to hire financial firms to help with big-money transactions and outside attorneys for work on everything from defending against lawsuits to negotiating labor agreements. But city officials are bound by few rules in determining who gets these lucrative jobs and why, and thanks to a gaping loophole in city procurement rules, the contracts for them are rarely put up for bid.
Mark Hands, a managing deputy procurement officer for the city, said city contracts are competitively bid on except in those instances where certain firms demonstrate a "unique or exclusive capability" for goods or services the city needs. "The Illinois Municipal Code exempts contracts 'which by their very nature are not adapted to award by competitive bidding, such as but not limited to contracts for the services of individuals possessing a high degree of professional skill where the ability or fitness of the individual plays an important part,'" Hands explains.
The city brings on private-sector lawyers for three reasons, according to law department spokeswoman Jenny Hoyle: they have expertise city attorneys lack, an outside attorney is needed to avoid a conflict of interest, or the city doesn't have enough lawyers available. Private lawyers are selected by the city's top lawyer, the corporation counsel, "based on their expertise in the relevant areas of the law," Hoyle said.
Word that the city had plans for a "super secret" long-term lease for the parking meters first went public in a leak to Sun-Times columnist Michael Sneed. On October 17, 2007, she wrote, "Sneed is told Mayor Daley's fiscal advisers are working on a deal to privatize the city's parking meters, which could potentially reap 1 BILLION bucks for the cash-strapped city." She reported that the city had hired legal and financial advisers to help.
In fact, the advisers had been working on the deal for months. In his recent press conference, as he tried to ward off criticism that the deal had been rushed, Daley pointed to a placard showing a timeline of the meter privatization process. This was the first time reporters had been shown these dates, and they indicated that the city hired William Blair in June 2007, four months before Sneed tipped us off that something was afoot, to begin "preliminary due diligence."
"This wasn't an idea just picked out of a hat to do this," Daley said. "This had been talked about for two years!"
When pressed for details on how and why William Blair was hired, Daley turned to Volpe, who said the firm had specialized experience in municipal finance as did the two other firms that had worked as financial consultants on the deal, Ramirez & Company and Gardner Rich. "There are very few firms that are qualified in this area," Volpe said.
The city has so far been unable or unwilling to provide more information on those qualifications.
Daley and Volpe have boasted that Chicago's long-term lease agreements have become a model that other municipalities are now seeking to emulate. But other cities have found other ways to do business.
For instance, in January Pittsburgh mayor Luke Ravenstahl announced that he wanted to explore leasing his city's public parking garages and meters in return for cash he could pour into the city's pension fund. A few weeks later the authority that oversees Pittsburgh's parking system invited firms to submit proposals for an ****ysis of the idea. It received nine responses and determined four were qualified. Next a committee made up of city officials, an authority attorney, an authority board member, and a union representative interviewed the firms before recommending a winner at a public meeting of the authority's board. Board members then approved up to $100,000 for the study.
The winner was Scott Balice Strategies, a woman-owned financial advisory firm based in Chicago.
As evidence of their commitment to "transparency," Daley administration officials often point to the city's Department of Procurement Services Web page, which includes a searchable database of city contracts, contractor records, and payment histories. But the site doesn't include any information about William Blair's work on the parking meter deal. Nor does it say anything about Gardner Rich or Ramirez & Company. Mark Hands said the information wasn't in the database because the firms were selected not through a procurement process but by the city's budget office.
On Friday, May 8, we requested an interview with Volpe to discuss the origin and terms of the deal, but budget department spokesman Pete Scales asked that we submit our questions in writing to him instead. Among those we sent in the following Monday: How was William Blair selected to consult on the meter lease agreement? How much was the company paid?
Scales hadn't responded to us by May 27, when we submitted Freedom of Information Act requests for copies of the agreement between the city and William Blair and all records generated by the firm during its work on the meter deal. The Illinois Freedom of Information Act requires a written response in seven working days, and Scales promised to get back to us. But he didn't respond to numerous follow-up calls and e-mails over the next couple of weeks. Finally, on Friday, June 12, just before 5 PM (not the first time we've heard back from the city at the end of the day on a Friday), he e-mailed us a copy of a "confidential" agreement between William Blair and the city outlining the company's responsibilities and pay rate on the parking meter deal. He also referred us to some documents, including the meter lease agreement and payment totals to William Blair, that had apparently just been posted on the Web site of the city's Department of Finance.
The agreement with William Blair that he forwarded us was dated January 7, 2008 a full six months after the date Daley gave for the commencement of the firm's work on the deal. Why was there a delay? Why didn't the city draw up a contract before the work began? Would the company possibly have worked for half a year without the compensation outlined in a contract? Scales didn't respond to e-mails asking those questions.
The agreement describes the company's work on the deal in the broadest terms: It was to "familiarize itself to the extent it deems appropriate" with the parking meter system, then "provide the City with financial advice and assistance" on a lease deal, such as conducting financial ****ysis and research, "developing and implementing" the solicitation of companies interested in bidding, and helping the city negotiate financial terms on the deal. It instructs the firm to work with Ramirez & Company and Gardner Rich as co-advisers and lays out what they'll be paid.
We've pieced together additional facts from documents the city provided in response to earlier questions we had about the value of the meter system. They suggest that William Blair oversaw nearly every aspect of the lease agreement. Companies interested in bidding on the meters were told to contact Tom Lanctot, a top official at the firm, and the official bids were opened at William Blair's headquarters under Lanctot's direction.
Blair's Web site notes that the company was the principal player in an earlier privatization effort: the leasing of the city's downtown parking garages, which in 2006 were turned over for 99 years to a partnership led by Morgan Stanley in return for $563 million in cash up front. "Our P3 team," for public-private partnership, "originated the idea for the long-term concession and lease of the 9,178 space Chicago Downtown Public Parking System," it says. Blair was paid $2.2 million for its work on that deal, according to the city.
The company's site also explains that the firm was even more deeply involved in the meter deal. "In our role as lead financial advisor, we managed a Request for Qualifications process to identify prospective bidders, developed a Confidential Information Memorandum, organized and presented bidder information meetings and system tours, structured the financial aspects of the concession, led the negotiation of the Concession Agreement, coordinated the bidder due diligence process and managed the competitive bidding process that involved North American and international bidders."
And there's one more thing: "William Blair & Company originated the idea for the transaction."
We called and then e-mailed Lanctot asking what that meant. Did someone at the company actually suggest to Mayor Daley that he lease the meters? If so, when?
Lanctot didn't respond, but a few minutes after our e-mail was sent, Tony Zimmer, Blair's spokesman, called. He referred us to Pete Scales.
The city has been no more forthcoming regarding Gardner Rich and Ramirez & Company. But both are minority-owned firms a crucial political consideration, given that the city's low minority contracting numbers are a regular source of contention in the otherwise pliant City Council.
All three financial firms were well-known to administration officials and to each other before the meter deal was under way. Last fall the Sun-Times reported that William Blair had donated at least $104,500 over the previous two years to After School Matters, a charity founded and run by Mayor Daley's wife, Maggie. William Blair's chairman, Edgar D. Jannotta, serves on the board of directors of Aon, which was founded and led for years by Patrick Ryan. Ryan retired from Aon last year and now serves at Daley's behest as chairman and CEO of Chicago's Olympic bid committee.
Gardner Rich also has ties to the city's political establishment. The firm is led by CEO Christopher P. Gardner, whose rags-to-riches story was the basis of the 2006 movie The Pursuit of Happyness. In 1994 Mayor Daley appointed Gardner to the School Finance Authority, a board that at the time oversaw school-reform policy for the Chicago Public Schools. Over the last few years his firm has worked on more than $1 billion worth of bond issues for the city, schools, Park District, and Water Reclamation District. "The day Richie is no longer mayor is the day I move out of here," Gardner told the Sun-Times in 2006.
In September 2007 Volpe announced that Ramirez & Company would be one of the chief managers of a $2 billion bond issue, the city's biggest led by minority-owned firms. Aldermen were pleased at the news; Volpe said the council and administration both deserved credit. "Our joint efforts to help grow the size and capacity of minority-owned firms have resulted in a larger, stronger stable of firms from which we can choose when we seek to issue bond transactions."
The truth, though, is that in recent years the city and other local government entities have typically relied on the same small group of firms for their big financial deals. Gardner Rich received $252,080 from the city for helping lease the Skyway in 2005, and along with Morgan Stanley was hired to work with Ramirez on the 2007 city bond issue. Ramirez was paid $351,875 to assist Blair with leasing the parking garages, and last July it was hired to work on a $150 million bond issue for Cook County a deal that caused a minor stir because Morgan Stanley was also employed to work on it not long after hiring William Daley Jr., nephew of both the mayor and his brother John, chairman of the county board's finance committee.
But what may have been just as notable about the county bond deal was the potential for conflicts of interest it created in the city's parking meter leasing process. At the same time Ramirez was advising the city on its "robust, open, transparent, and competitive bid process" for the meters, the firm was also working on a county bond issue with one of the bidders the one, in fact, that ended up winning the contract.
And that's just one of several instances where the advisers on the meter deal were working alongside the winning bidder, Morgan Stanley, even as the bidding process was going on. In March 2008 Gardner Rich and Morgan Stanley helped the city issue up to $560 million in water revenue bonds. That same month Morgan Stanley, William Blair, and Ramirez & Company all worked on a $2 billion bond deal for the CTA.
Experts say there's no reason that a firm with a history of working successfully with the city shouldn't be hired again. But they stress that it's not smart for a government to simultaneously use the same firms as advisers and bond managers. "It is definitely inadvisable because it reduces independent judgment which is what governments need when making investment decisions," says H. Woods Bowman, a professor of economics, finance, and ethics at DePaul who served as the county's chief financial officer in the 1990s.
But, he added, "I presume you will agree that what's weird elsewhere is sometimes normal in Chicago."
Normal or not, the overlapping relationships of the lease deal's top adviser and winning bidder appear to skirt the city's own contracting rules. The city's procurement law, posted on its Web site, says, "If the contracting parties assist the city in determining the advisability or feasibility of a project or in recommending, researching, preparing, drafting or issuing a request for proposals or bid specifications for a project, the Contracting Parties must not participate, directly or indirectly, as a prime, subcontractor or joint venturer in that project."
"The Contracting Parties may, however, assist the city in reviewing the proposals or bids for the project if none of the contracting parties have a relationship with the persons or entities that submitted the proposals or bids for that project."
Every big government financial deal also needs lawyers, and the meter lease was no exception. Among the firms who performed legal work for the deal were those who worked on the big CTA bond issue at the same time: Katten Muchin Rosenman and Gonzalez Saggio & Harlan. They were joined by a third, Charity & associates.
Law department spokeswoman Jenny Hoyle said the firms were picked by corporation counsel Mara Georges and first deputy corporation counsel Jim McDonald, the primary city lawyer working on the meter deal. They were chosen for their expertise "and the fact that they met our diversity objectives in the retention of outside counsel," Hoyle said.
Work on the meter deal was divided up among the three firms. According to Hoyle, Katten wrote the lease agreement and researched state legal issues. Gonzalez Saggio wrote the ordinance authorizing the city to enter into the agreement which the City Council passed by a 40-5 vote. And Charity "worked on operating standards and real estate aspects," Hoyle says.
The firms were paid $475 per lawyer per hour, according to letters the city sent the firms outlining the scope of their work. By the time the work was done Katten had been paid $662,759.64, Gonzalez Saggio $162,461.50, and Charity $522,485.50.
All three law firms have long-standing relationships with the mayor and his administration. Since the 2005 Hired Truck scandal, when the Sun-Times revealed that politically connected trucking firms were paid millions to do little or no work, the city has been sending a letter to contractors warning them that it "prohibits bidders, contractors and subcontractors from making political contributions to the Mayor or his fundraising committee." But law firms hired by the city aren't covered by these contracting rules, and according to state campaign finance records, since 2001 attorneys with Katten have written Daley checks adding up to more than $33,000. Meanwhile the city paid the firm a total of $160,000 for legal work on the leases of the Skyway and downtown parking garages.
But if Katten has a special connection to Mayor Daley, it's through partner Terry Newman. According to the Katten Web site, Newman's legal specialty is "real estate taxation," but he's known around town as one of the mayor's best friends. Before joining the firm he worked as a prosecutor under the mayor, then the Cook County state's attorney. Over the last 15 years, Newman has been mentioned frequently in local gossip columns as a regular at Daley's private parties. "As often as three nights a week Daley indulges in a 'boys' night out,'" Fran Spielman wrote in the Sun-Times in 1995. "Around the dinner table at Carlucci's, Marche or Parrinello's is what one friend calls a 'floating crap game of associates.' The list almost always includes Loop attorney Terry Newman, a jovial type considered one of the mayor's closet friends."
In 1992 the mayor appointed Newman to the board of trustees of the City Colleges of Chicago; he's now its secretary. He's also the chairman of the board of directors for After School Matters. In November 2006 Newman cohosted a $1,000-a-ticket fund-raiser for Daley.
The other firms have their own ties to the administration. Elvin Charity, one of the partners in Charity & associates, has donated about $3,500 to Daley since 2001 and thousands of dollars more to the coffers of many aldermen, including Ed Burke, chairman of the City Council's finance committee, which held the hearings on the parking meter deal. In 1992 the mayor tapped Charity for the Community Development Commission, which oversees the tax increment financing program; he served until 2000. In 2006 the city paid Charity & associates $420,000 for legal work on the lease of the downtown parking garages.
Gonzalez Saggio & Harlan has been paid thousands of dollars over the last three years for work related to the city's potential leasing of its garbage sorting centers. The partner who worked on the parking meter deal was Timothy Wright, who recently served as the attorney for his own former law partner, Senator Roland Burris, who's also donated to the mayor and numerous aldermen over the last several years. Another Gonzalez partner, Ferhan Hamid, worked as an assistant comptroller for the Daley administration, where, according to his bio, he was an "integral part" of the city finance team that worked out long-term lease deals for the Skyway, Midway airport, and the parking garages.
The company that won the rights to the parking garages? Morgan Stanley. In its  *** ing report on the agreement, the inspector general's office concluded that the city may have leased the meters for $974 million less than they were worth. The reason, the report concluded, was that William Blair's calculations of the system's value were all done from the perspective of an investor they were based on what that investor might be willing and able to pay for the meters, not what their value was to the city. "The City should have conducted this ****ysis so that its decision about whether to lease the parking-meter system now and if so, under what terms could be made in the most informed fashion possible," the report states. "The failure to conduct this ****ysis strongly suggests that the decision had already been made that the City was going to lease the meters for the best-available price on the market."
The report didn't address questions such as why that ****ysis wasn't conducted, who made the decisions to put the system on the market regardless of other factors, how it was determined which advisers would be brought in, how much decision-making power they would have, whether any conflict-of-interest safeguards were put into place, and just what communications occurred among all of the parties while the deal was being conceived, designed, and executed. The public doesn't have any of these answers. The companies involved aren't required to say. The mayor and his top aides say they're committed to transparency. But so far nobody's talking. v
Initially it was thought the boys, likely aged 10 or 11, might have been from Nanaimo, B.C.
But they have now been identified as students who lived in Castlegar, said Greg Luterbach, the Kootenay-Columbia school district's superintendent.
The boys and their ages cannot be identified because of their youth, Luterbach said. The school has not identified the teacher whom the students were allegedly trying to hurt.
The school district turned the video over to the local RCMP, who say no charges will be laid.
Luterbach said the school district will do an internal risk assessment and handle any punishment, while the RCMP have contacted the boys and their families.
Disturbing video
The two boys acted out various scenarios, including using toy guns, to **** a teacher.
The video was posted to YouTube, but when it was highlighted on a Facebook page belonging to an American radio station, the original posting quickly disappeared.
The B.C. Teachers' Federation has notified Vancouver police about the video, said president Jim Iker in a written statement on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Defense (MoD) said the incident took place in the vicinity of Duab district after an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) went off prematurely.
MoD further added that the wounded Taliban leaders have been identified as Qari Mohammad Hanif, Salahuddin, Juma, Mohammad Shah, and Dad Mohammad.
According to MoD, the Taliban leaders have sustained serious injuries in the explosion.
The Taliban militants group has not commented regarding the report so far.
Taliban militants and insurgents belonging to other militant groups are frequently using Improvised Explosive Device (IED) as the weapon of their choice to target the security forces and government officials.
However, in majority of such attacks, the ordinary civilians are targeted as the anti-government armed militants are accused of incurring the most casualties to the civilians.
The United Nations assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said late in October that the mission has documented 8,397 conflict-related civilian casualties (2,562 deaths and 5,835 injured) between 1 January and 30 September, representing a one per cent decrease compared to the same period in 2015.
Ground engagements remained the leading cause of civiliancasualties, followed by suicide and complex attacks, and improvised explosive devices (IEDs).
The film, formerly called œThe Papers, centers on the Washington Post's decision to publish the classified Pentagon Papers in 1971. The movie, expected to contend during awards season, will see a limited release on Dec. 22 and go wide on Jan. 12, 2018.
œThe Post is co-financed by Fox and Amblin Entertainment with Fox handling domestic distribution. Amblin will handle international through its output deals with Universal, eOne, Reliance, and others.
Hanks is portraying the Post's editor Ben Bradlee and Streep is playing publisher Katherine Graham. In 1971, the paper decided to publish revelations from the 47-volume Pentagon Papers study after President Richard Nixon and Attorney General John Mitc ***  got a federal court injunction forcing the New York Times to cease publication of the papers after three installments.
The New York Times and Washington Post jointly appealed to the Supreme Court on First Amendment grounds and the high court ruled 6-3 that the government failed to prove a harm to national security and that publication was justified by the First Amendment.
The cast includes Sarah Paulson, Bob Odenkirk, Matthew Rhys, Bradley Whitford, Carrie Coon, Jesse Plemons, David Cross, Alison Brie, Bruce Greenwood, Tracy Letts, and Michael Stuhlbarg.
Fox also announced Friday that it has moved the release of Dylan O'Brien's sci-fi actioner œMaze Runner: The Death Cure forward two weeks from Feb. 9 to Jan. 26.
Corey Lewandowski   a pugnacious hothead whose bad temper cost him a job managing the Trump campaign last summer   has remained largely out of the news since the end of his gig as one of CNN's Trump fluffers.
Last we heard from him, Lewandowski, a noted lobbyist hater, was getting into the lobbying business. It was one of the earliest indications that œdrain the swamp was always more of a slogan than a promise. Now we have further proof of that courtesy of Politico, which revealed Friday that Lewandowski has been promising face time with Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence to potential lobbying clients around the world
A document provided to an Eastern European politician by an international consulting firm that Lewandowski co-founded this year promises to arrange œmeetings with well-established figures, including Trump, Pence, œkey members of the U.S. Administration, and outside Trump allies.
The firm   which Lewandowski founded with Ben Carson's former campaign manager, Barry Bennett   is called Washington East West Political Strategies. It was created to drum up Eastern European clients for Avenue Strategies, the lobbying firm that Lewandowski and Bennett also founded together. The duo has several of these firms around the world, Bennett told Politico, aimed at directing clients toward their D.C. firm.
Lewandowski's promises to call Trump or cabinet members on behalf of his clients may not be improper, but it is unseemly   particularly for a White House that has already made a joke out of its stated intention to eliminate cronyism and influence-peddling. But there don't appear to be indications that it will stop. Lewandowski enjoys easy access to Trump, both over the phone and in the West Wing, and he's aggressive in trading on that.
It's a bird! It's a plane! No, it's an anarchic, copyright-flouting peer-to-peer filesharing site hosted from a high-altitude balloon.
That, at least, is the vision of some members of Pirate Parties International (PPI). PPI serves as an umbrella organization for intellectual property reform-focused "Pirate Parties" around the world, which until April included PiratPartiet, the Swedish Pirate Party with ties to the peer-to-peer site the Pirate Bay and whistle-blower organization Wikileaks. Last weekend, a group of Pirate Party members on the group's mailing list began discussing plans for a high-altitude balloon that would host a filesharing site in the sky, ideally out of the legal reach of any authorities whose intellectual property regulations could have it shut down.
"We plan to use some kind of balloon and try to keep it up in the air for as long as possible," writes a Swedish engineer named Erik LÃ¶nroth, "Hopefully irritating the crap out of authorities in as many countries as possible."
The spirited--if somewhat unfocused--discussion that followed included ideas for an onboard computer from open-source hardware maker Gumstix, solar panels, and a weather balloon.
Francisco George, a member of the Pirate Party's Spanish national committee suggests reading the airborne signal with Skygrabber software, the same program used by hackers to intercept satellite Internet signals and Iraqi insurgents to hijack military drones' video feeds. He also proposes raising money for the project with the crowdsourcing site Kickstarter.
Do not, of course, start tuning your pirate satellite dishes just yet. Whether anything remotely realistic will result from the Pirate Party's brainstorming is somewhat doubtful. Technical challenges involved in maintaining and updating the airborne site would be enormous. And the Pirate Party hasn't even decided on some basic goals yet: Some members argue for testing a sea-based site, along the lines of the Pirate Bay's failed attempt in 2007 to host their servers on Sealand, a former military base turned independent principality off the coast of England.
Others, including Pirate Party co-chairman Gregory Engels, seem to prefer the idea of a low-Earth-orbit satellite that would be harder to launch but easier to keep airborne than a slowly-deflating balloon. He points to a wiki already created in June by a German pirate party member to assemble ideas for that space-based piracy plan.
As unlikely, early-stage, and vaguely insane as the whole project may be, you have to admire the Pirate movement's tenacity and imagination in fighting the ever-encroaching legal threats to peer-to-peer filesharing, which may shut down popular sources of copyright-infringing music and video files including the Pirate Bay and Isohunt.
ALEX SALMOND was last night savaged by opponents after suggesting Scotland can declare independence without taking a vote on the issue again.
Days after decisively losing in the Scottish referendum, the First Minister shocked rivals by suggesting that a vote would not be needed to make a unilateral declaration of independence.
The First Minister hinted strongly on Sunday morning that a referendum was only one route to independence.
He said that a parliament with more powers could declare an end to the 300-year old Union without seeking a mandate from the people or authority from Westminster.
Salmond carefully stated that a repeat of a "once in a generation" referendum could be avoided if circumstances change.
He said: œThere are a number of political opportunities coming up. For many, many years, a referendum route wasn't the chosen route of the Scottish National Party or Scotland. "
"For many years, there was a gradual attitude to independence.
"That is to say that you establish a parliament and you establish successively more powers until you have a situation where you're independent in all but name, and then presumably you declare yourself to be independent.
"Many countries have proceeded through that route; there is a parliamentary route where people can make their voice heard as well, so a referendum is only one of a number of routes."
The move was pounced on by fundamentalist nationalists with former party deputy leader Jim Sillars stating that an SNP majority in the 2016 Holyrood election would be a mandate for separation.
Sillars tweeted: "Let Yes assert new indy rule “ no more ref “ majority votes and seats at Holyrood 2016 enough."
But the idea was immediately condemned by Scottish Labour as undemocratic and illegal.
Johann Lamont said such a move would be an attempt to "overthrow the will of the Scottish people in some sort of coup".
The Scottish Labour leader said: œHaving decisively lost a democratic referendum on independence, Alex Salmond is now suggesting the nationalists can ignore the sovereign will of the Scottish people.
œHis words are fundamentally undemocratic and an insult to the people of Scotland."
œSalmond may regret the result but this reaction is dangerous and wrong. Alex Salmond lost. It is not for him to try to overthrow the will of the Scottish people in some sort of coup.
œHe cannot react to the result by giving Scotland a row.
œI trust his likely successor Nicola Sturgeon will distance herself from these disgraceful remarks. While the rest of us seek reconciliation Alex Salmond seeks more division. Scotland will not have it.
Jackson Carlaw of the Scottish Conservatives said: "The First Minister's grace in defeat barely lasted a day. Going by the extraordinary outburst there is anything but acceptance in the Salmond household."
He added: "Scotland spoke very clearly and quite decisively, the majority made clear that the "sovereign will" of the people of Scotland is to remain in a UK in which further responsibilities are devolved to Holyrood.
"Mr Salmond misunderstood the will of the majority during the campaign and now he seeks to misrepresent it in defeat."
Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, said: "I think the First Minister needs to calm down and take a bit of a breather."
The debate on how to stage the next step to independence will now frame the contest for Salmond's successor as leader.
Hardcore SNP members have stated that they will only endorse leadership candidates who will offer an immediate re-run of an independence referendum as soon as possible.
Freerunning in Iraq's capital is dangerous, he says, and freerunners often misunderstood
Baghdad Pk group often trains in Zawra park, near city's fomer Green Zone
Members are self-taught and rely on internet videos to learn new techniques
Leaping from rooftops and doing backflips off walls is when Prince Haydar feels the most free.
The 25-year-old from Baghdad is one of the city's small band of freerunners, who take every opportunity to practice parkour in a city striving for normality and currently facing a resurgence of deadly violence.
"When I do parkour, I get rid of all the scattered thoughts in my head and empty all the anger from inside me," said Haydar.
From the streets of Paris in the 1990s, where parkour was first popularized, to Zawra park in Iraq's capital, freerunning has become a global phenomenon. The sport evolved from French military training and involves running through urban environments using only the body to overcome obstacles and objects.
In Baghdad, the challenges are even greater than in other cities. Haydar says his fellow freerunners have to contend with a public unsure of what to make of a group running and leaping through the city's largest public park. There is also the threat of bomb attacks and indiscriminate violence in the city.
"It is dangerous and it is difficult to practice parkour anywhere," he says. "Sometimes we are exposed to arrested or misunderstanding from some people and there is the deteriorating security situation."
But despite these challenges, Haydar is committed to improving in his sport, and teaching its benefits to others. He was first turned on to freerunning in 2007 when he watched the film "District B13" that featured parkour in many of its stunt sequences. Inspired, he sought out internet clips of the sport in order to learn parkour techniques.
"We are a small group of young people and there are no parkour classes," he says, noting that the group -- aged between 18 and 25 -- support and teach each other, going as far as pooling their money to rent a gym.
"It's small and does not meet the purpose," he says. "It's very far from our homes, but despite of all these difficult circumstances we go."
A dalit manual scavenging. Dalit Network under a Creative Commons Licence
We pretend that people are not condemned to the caste system, Mari Marcel Thekaekara writes.
In 1996, I listened in disbelief as Martin Macwan, a dalit leader, told a Delhi gathering, 'I am ashamed that as a dalit, working with my people for over 10 years, I did not know that balmiki people still carry  ***  on their heads everyday of their lives.' It was on the eve of 50 years of independence from British colonialism. The Indian economy, we were told at that time, was poised to take off. Indians were ready to take over the internet world. Silicon Valley was ours for the asking. Yet we couldn't deal with our own excrement with a modicum of decency. Women scooped it up, of different textures, from large open gutters, with a tin sheet, a stick broom and their bare hands. These were semi-urban toilets.
Putting on my journalistic hat, I went to Gujarat in early 1997 and visited public toilet after public toilet. I gagged often. I thought it was the worst thing I'd ever seen. And I have not led a sheltered life. Then I interviewed the family of a 19-year-old balmiki boy who while unblocking a manhole, was overcome by the toxic fumes, fell inside and died. He died for the paltry sum of about seven dollars. The boy died of drowning. Drowned in excrement. Till then I'd never given any thought to the common tiny news item 'Man falls into manhole. Dies.' I learnt later what this innocuously misleading little item truly meant. Imagine the indignity, the sheer horror, of drowning in  *** . Imagine the nightmares his parents must have had. But perhaps they are inured to life and death as a balmiki conservancy worker.
In 1999 I wrote a book, Endless Filth' about the horrible caste based liftetime occupation of the balmiki community, India's 'untouchables' among 'untouchables'. They are considered the lowest in India's venal caste system and no one ever let them forget it.
Advert
That was in 1997. I have written endless newspaper articles about these people and the life they are condemned to lead by the caste system. Educated Indians ignore the unpleasant. We prefer to pretend it doesn't exist.
Almost 20 years later, little has changed. My good friend Bejawada Wilson continues to fight for his balmiki community to end the obnoxious, disgusting practice of manual scavenging. This year 14 April will see huge hypocritical celebrations on the 125th birth anniversary of towering Indian leader Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar who fought ferociously for dalit rights. Politicians of every hue can be seen jumping on the bandwagon to claim his legacy as liberators of dalits. Few of them ever bother to enforce the formidable barrage of laws which if put into practice could end the horrific atrocities faced by dalits on a daily basis. Every day, around three men die unblocking manholes in conservancy work. Ahmedabad NGO Kamdar Swasthya Suraksha Mandal believes that at a conservative estimate, there could be over 1,000 manhole worker deaths per year across India. The real figures are much higher as many deaths are covered up and go unreported even today.
India flaunts its global presence and boasts about India's emerging image. Yet, we seek to hide the sordid reality of no toilets and the most neglected Indians dying everyday in a manner that must shame Indian society, any decent society. But we are a venal, thick skinned people. We don't shame easily.
Bejawada Wilson and the Safai Karmachari Andolan have held a mammoth bus yatra (journey) covering every corner of the county. Their banner says 'Stop Killing Us'. The memorandum was handed over to the president of India last week. Wilson says, 'In India today, we talk about spending thousands of millions on a single bullet train, but haven't yet found a way to automatize our sewer cleaning. The enormous hype generated by the 'Swacch (clean) Bharat (India)' campaign literally sweeps into obscurity, the dirt of manual scavenging and balmiki mens' deaths by drowning in  *** hole sewers, even now in 2016, though Gandhi raised the issue and made untouchability a global term in 1901.'
On 26th June a district court in Cologne made a landmark ruling that parents do not have the right to circumcise their children without a medical reason.
The case centred on a 4 year old boy who was circumcised by a doctor at the request of his Muslim parents in 2010. Two days later the boy suffered bleeding complications from which he later made a full recovery. Charges of grievous bodily harm were brought against the doctor. Although the doctor was acquitted because the law had not been sufficiently clear at the time, the court ruled that it would now be unlawful for circumcision to be performed on a child without a medical reason. Circumcisions for medical reasons or on consenting adults are not affected by this ruling.
Parental consent to religious circumcision was judged to be in conflict with the best interests of the child. The court ruled that the "fundamental right of the child to physical integrity and self-determination outweighed the fundamental rights of the parents", stating that there was an inherent constitutional limit to the religious rights of the parents. The child was too young to give consent and the parents did not have the right to consent on his behalf to a procedure that would lead to his body being 'permanently and irreparably changed' and that could affect his own religious interests later.
Considerations of 'social adequacy' or necessity for him to be a part of his culture were judged inadequate to justify a breach of Germany's basic law “ similar to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).
In the same week, significant new evidence emerged in the UK of the serious complication rate from ritual circumcision. It is already well known that circumcision removes one of the most sensitive parts of the  *** *, affects assass function for life and will often cause additional side effects such as bleeding, infection, urinary difficulties, and psychoassass difficulties.
As a result of a freedom of information request, it was found that, in one hospital alone in 2011, 11 baby boys needed to beadmitted to the hospital's paediatric intensive care unit with serious, life-threatening complications following circumcision. In this age group there is rarely a medical reason for circumcision so it is likely that all of these babies' lives were threatened by an operation on their normal bodies that they did not need.
In February 2012, a baby boy died in North London as a direct result of bleeding complications two days after a ritual circumcision. In this case the coroner ruled that it was a tragic, 'unforeseen' accident and that the rabbi who performed the circumcision was not to blame.
Religious justifications for ritual circumcision rest on the bankrupt premise that all baby boys born to Jews and Muslims will themselves identify with those religions and that they would want this to have been done to them in childhood. Further, the harms caused by this operation are frequently denied or diminished. Those men who dare to speak out are often humiliated and dismissed or ridiculed for daring to compare the assault on their normal genitals with the suffering of girls and women even though there is a wide spectrum of harm in both girls and boys when their genitals are cut for no therapeutic reason and the ethical principle is identical.
Circumcision apologists and advocates will often say that they have never heard any men complain so they don't believe there can be a problem. There is a problem, and it's time we addressed it.
The German court ruling decision was discussed on BBC One's Sunday Morning Live show with Samira Ahmed. Dr Antony Lempert appeared on the programme which is available to view until 10am Sunday morning. Here is a link to the show (30 minutes in).
Sorry, the point here isn't to quote Black Sheep, as much fun as that would be. All season, we've documented the problems with the Hawks' defense. Myself, McClure, Jen have come here and trotted out various numbers to demonstrate Oduya's decline, Rozsival's inability to move, and the various problems with Rundblad.
Essentially, the Hawks have three top pairing d-men, which is good. All of Keith, Hjalmarsson, and Seabrook would comfortably be on the top pairing of most if not all NHL teams. They also have three bottom pairing d-men in Oduya, Rozsival, and Rundblad, and that's probably being kind to Rozsival and Rundblad who almost certainly should be rotating in as #6 or #7 d-men. Tim Erixon is now the new Kim Johnsson, and is dead.
So the solution is, or the need is, the Hawks need a d-man in the middle. They don't need a top pairing guy, but they need someone to bridge from the top to the bottom. It doesn't look like it's on the roster. After two seasons playing into June and an Olympics, it's unlikely that Oduya is going to rebound to anything close to 2013 or even last year's slightly less glittering form. Rozsival? Forget it.
Rundblad is a more interesting study. It's obvious what his skills are. Big shot, good passer. Rundblad's problem is that he's insistent on making a pass. And when he's under pressure, and his forwards aren't giving him an option, he's going to wait and wait for that option to present itself, all the way until he's swallowed up by a forecheck. His other problem is he just doesn't have the feet to open up additional passing lanes for himself. He's got the one when he picks up the puck, and that's about it. I'm not sure that's ever going to change, and if it is it's going to take more time than the Hawks have right now.
I suppose the Hawks are praying, and I mean seriously offering sacrifices and and saying Our Fathers constantly, that Trevor van Riemsdyk solves this. And I suppose you can foresee in the playoffs that TVR provides a more solid platform for Keith than Rundblad, Seabrook and Hammer continue to be solid enough, and Oduya is just used as the 5th guy as when we get to the playoffs Q usually only rolls with five D anyway. I suppose that's not totally farfetched.
But you can't count on it. The only other stretch I can think of within the organization is calling up Dahlbeck, have him play centerfield for Keith, and TVR-Oduya is your third pairing. But A) the Hawks would be carrying 9 d-men then and B) there probably isn't enough time in the season for Q to find any comfort with Dahlbeck (but I still really want to see what he can do with a mobile partner instead of what he got earlier in the year).
Which means you have to go out and get one, and the options we've gone over and are not plentiful. Jeff Petry? Not sure he moves well enough to up the mobility on the blue line. Andrej Sekera might, but it's not clear that the Canes are actually going to move him. The real hail mary and take a shot with Kimmo Timonen? I don't know.
Whatever the solution, the only way the Hawks can do this is by losing something off the roster that's more than a minimum guy. And the only two candidates are Andrew Shaw and Marcus Kruger. I guess technically it could be Oduya too, but they're all-in with him.
You may think this is part of an anti-Shaw campaign I've been waging all season, and I guess I can't totally avoid that. And part of this is still clinging to the utter fantasy that the Hawks will come to the conclusion that the rest of the world has, Andrew Shaw is not a center. Because he isn't. He doesn't have the defensive awareness and it robs him of his aggressiveness in the offensive zone. He's just more active on the wing. But if you finally declare him a wing, you come to the conclusion that the only open wing spots are on the 4th line. And 4th line wingers are not supposed to be what comes between you and a parade.
Long-term, you'd only be losing a little more of Shaw than you might normally be, because he has to be a candidate to be purged for cap reasons in the summer. You simply can't re-sign him after next year for the $3 million or so he'd get. So you have to cash him in for assets in the summer anyway.
Yes, that leaves a hole at center, and if you're not convinced Teuvo can take that over now I'm not going to stop you. But even if he's not, you could slot Kruger on the 3rd line with Ben Smith on the 4th and I'm not convinced you're that much worse off. Yes, the fear of losing someone effective on the wall and around the net for the playoffs, which Shaw can be, is worrisome. But he's none of those things as a center right now.
Kruger would be the bigger loss, but might have more value. His penalty killing is a more valuable skill than Shaw's work on the power play, which could be replaced by Smith. Kruger hasn't bee used exclusively as a checking center this year as he was last, but that's still in the bag. If he were to go, Smith would have to take over that role and while he has the brain for it and the strength, he doesn't have Kruger's skates. Kruger is also the cheaper of the two, and if and when he's re-signed this summer he shouldn't cost much more than he does now at $1.4 million.

For today, after years of searching for answers as to what could be causing your constant, terrifying dreams of CULTIST TERRORS you have perhaps found the means to an answer. For today, you seek an audience with VAERMINA, the DAEDRIC PRINCE OF NIGHTMARES.
The only way for an ordinary, non-cultist mortal to speak face-to-face with a Daedric Prince is through the summoners of the CABAL, an elite group of mages who do not come cheap nor serve just anyone. But the mysterious and alluring alchemist SIGRID has agreed to help you on your plight, scheduling for the unholy Prince of Nightmares to be summoned, here in Kvatch, at the stroke of midnight.
And now, you have arrived in the guild to seek your answers. Midnight rapidly approaches, you have many questions to ask, and you do not intend to squander one moment of this opportunity.

Sure, maybe your compatriots in the guard think your continual suspicions of CULTIST PLOTS are irrational, and maybe they don't believe your incredibly reasonable assertions that INVISIBLE CULTISTS could be standing around us right now, but that doesn't mean you should start strapping weapons to a bunch of dogs so they can watch your back while you sleep.

And as mentioned in this paper on Thursday, BCCI joint secretary Anurag Thakur and former board chief IS Bindra abstained from the meeting.
Although the official reason cited for cancelling the meeting was œtechnical   the word ˜emergency' must be mentioned if a working committee meeting is called abruptly   an insider told dna that Srinivasan was also warned of contempt of court, which declared BCCI's internal probe panel as illegal.
According to another report, Srinivasan initially insisted that the high court's orders were mere observations and not binding on the board. But the discomfort in the room was reportedly quite palpable, with IPL's governing council members texting each other frantically about Srini's presence.
Apparently, one governing council member, too, pointed out the lack of transparency in the BCCI's procedure to appoint its inquiry panel. An intense argument apparently ensued and the meeting ended abruptly. The BCCI, meanwhile, has decided to move Supreme Court on Tuesday to challenge the HC. Jagmohan Dalmiya will continue to manage the board's affairs in the interim.
BCCI secretary Sanjay Patel said, œAs a matter of principle, the members confirmed that it was important that the governing council's actions be and be seen to be both legally and ethically correct. The governing council believes that the probe commission was properly constituted in accordance with the IPL operational rules, and has consequently decided that an appeal should be filed in the Honourable Supreme Court.
Once again Jaitley emerged as the key man who convinced Srinivasan to exercise prudence. It is learnt that Jaitley suggested that the only way Srinivasan could seek legal re-dress against the HC judgment was by not chairing Friday's meeting. Else, Srinivasan should brace up for more litigation from across the country like the one bothering the board at this point.
The legal opinion was wisely taken into the account by Srinivasan, and it took less than 10 minutes for the BCCI mandarins to devise a strategy and maintain a status quo.
It is fair to say that Srini had no choice but heed Jaitley's advice. And so for the second time in as many months, Jaitley had his way. Remember, it was Jaitley and Thakur who forced Srinivasan to œstep aside till the board's internal panel completed its inquiry against his son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan.

Well it took nine long frustrating years but Arsenal FC have finally won a trophy and the script couldn't have been written any better, the last trophy Arsenal won is the first they won to end the nine year drought, the FA Cup. No one including me ever saw this drought coming when Arsenal beat Manchester United in the 2005 FA Cup Final, and hopefully Arsenal fans wont have to go through that again.
Now that the club have tasted what winning silverware taste like hopefully they will want more and will strive even harder to win the league title and any other competition they are in for the 2014-2015 season. I have to give credit to Hull City though, clearly the underdogs in this final yet from the start they came out swinging. By the 10th minute of the game they were up two to zero, and as a Arsenal fan myself I could only shake my head in utter disappointment and dread.
Then as fate would have it Santi Cazorla scored a stunning free kick before the half to give a 2-1 scoreline, at this point it was game on and hope returned to the Arsenal fans, but it was slowly getting away as Arsenal could not break Hull's defense until Laurent Koscielny scored in the 70th minute of the game. Into extra time the game went and I thought it may end up in a penalty shootout, but then the Welshman Ramsey scored in extra time and the feeling for all the gunners including myself was indescribable. At last a trophy finally landing for Arsenal.
Now hopefully during the summer Arsenal will buy a striker and maybe a couple of defenders and strengthen the squad enough to compete with the top clubs in England and Europe.

One of the principal purposes of the IPA is to records the phone calls, internet browsing records and other data traffic of every person in the country, just in case it comes in useful later. Namely “ to create an internal surveillance system. This was quite rightly judged to be illegal by The Court of Justice of the European Union, although the government is yet to meaningfully respond to the ruling. One can only surmise that our impending exit from the jurisdiction of the CJEU will mean that any protection afforded by the judgement will be short lived, if it ever materialises at all.
Apparently undeterred by this small setback, the government now appears to be considering new, even more oppressive, legislation which would easily fulfil a key requirement on any aspiring dictator's to do list “ that of control of the press.

Proposals for a new ˜Espionage Bill' are quietly being considered by the UK Law Commission and would replace official Secrets Acts dating back to 1911, but they go much further than that in their scope.
Their recommendations, due to be finalised by April 3rd, are contained in a consultation paper entitled ˜Protection of Official Data' which pointedly targets those who both communicate and obtain leaked information, classifying them as spies liable to spend up to 14 years in prison. Crucially it also seeks to remove the statutory public interest defence for finding, handling and releasing such information.
Anyone publishing or even re-publishing already leaked material that is œcapable of benefiting a foreign power would be a crime. Of course that definition would be open to a wide interpretation by anyone seeking to hush up something they wanted kept quiet, for example it's been speculated that this will include any information about the forthcoming Brexit negotiations.

Journalists would be walking a virtual tightrope with little confidence about the implications of revealing any information they had obtained through unofficial channels. This flies in the face of previous guidance and legislation on the fair treatment of whistle blowers, meaning that hackers, journalists, NGOs and even elected politicians could now be treated in the same way as foreign agents, even if the information they reveal is in the public interest.
Jodie Ginsberg, chief executive of free expression campaign group Index on Censorship, said
œThe proposed changes are frightening and have no place in a democracy, which relies on having mechanisms to hold the powerful to account. It is unthinkable that whistle blowers and those to whom they reveal their information should face jail for leaking and receiving information that is in the public interest.
Whistle-blower Edward Snowden, who also lambasted The Investigatory Powers Act as something that would make most despotic regimes green with envy, said of these new proposals

œIt is alarming that such a far-reaching proposed reform of laws which could be used to jail whistle blowers and journalists should have been drafted without any adequate consultation with free speech organisations.
Despite claims from the Commission to have œconsulted widely, The National Union of Journalists have said they were told nothing and were never contacted. The Commission themselves have confirmed that most British organisations concerned with human rights and free expression have not been involved. This includes the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, the Centre for Investigative Reporting, Reporters Without Borders, Amnesty International, Article 19, Open Democracy, Privacy International, Index On Censorship and the writers group PEN. They did however seek advice from MI5 and MI6 as well as selected media corporations.
Ironically, Parliament itself has often been the source of many a leaked document. Indeed it's seemed in recent years that leaks have become the preferred method of announcing government proposals, to test the water and perhaps reduce the shock of unpopular legislation when it's officially announced. This proposed bill itself is only being discussed now due to what could easily be characterised as a leak. Were this legislation to be in force at the moment I might be treated to a night in the cells, or worse, simply for writing about it.
That threat of jail can only serve to effectively curtail any investigative journalist who values his or her freedom. Investigative journalism by its very nature involves discovering something that someone doesn't want to be found. The mere act of happening across some information in the course of researching a story, or speaking to a source could see journalists arrested and prosecuted, or at the very least threatened with as much if they don't keep quiet. Official government stamped announcements will become the only safe sources of news, regardless of its veracity or the agenda of those behind it. Effectively we will have a state controlled press.
It's clear that we're seeing both an orchestrated attack on the rights of a free media, along with a more subversive undermining of faith in news reporting across all platforms. In many ways the discussions around so called fake news also plays into this scenario. This isn't a coincidence and it would not be surprising if similar legislation is drafted in the USA before too long. If Nixon could be brought down by two determined journalists exposing the Watergate scandal, how paranoid is the Trump administration likely to be? assuming it's humanly possible to be more paranoid than Trump.
An unfettered and trusted media is part of the bedrock of a free and democratic society, even if both those concepts are at times questionable in themselves. We mustn't allow shady, oppressive legislation to drive real journalism into the shadows. As we all know, knowledge is power and a free press should keep that power with the people, where it belongs.

US ***star turned ˜ex-ass' Christian fundamentalist Joseph Sciambra has recorded a bizarre video where he claims that **** *** causes *** men to give birth to the devil.
In the video, Sciambra who formerly appeared in ***for many years says that after finding God, he sought hospitalisation following damage caused to his rectum that meant he had to have his œsphincters almost stitched shut.
In the video he said: œI'm going to talk about the devil and why he loves **** ass. **** *** releases into the world rare demonic entities and that even in the body could be conceived as the devil and that would be given birth to ****ly.
Describing his experiences in the *** industry he said:There is a definite dark shadow when you are involved with this stuff. I did BDSM bondage ass.
Warning the viewers of his ministry, Sciambra said :The anus was never designed by nature to accommodate the  *** *. It just wasn't meant to be. When you do get involved with that activity it causes a lot of physical damage- I can testify that first hand. When I got out of ass, I started having problems straight away. About two years later, I had surgery, it was horrible I had to have my sphincters almost stitched shut.
Concluding his video, the former *** star tells viewers about the œspiritual and mental damage that **** *** can do. I do believe that it creates a doorway literally into the demonic, the supernatural.
It's called LBRY (pronounced œlibrary), and it essentially uses a blockchain to decentralize and improve upon BitTorrent, NetFlix, or other content distribution services. If it works, someday we may all be opening LBRY to browse films, music, and ebooks rather than the many subscriber services we use today.
LBRY co-founder Jeremy Kauffman explains: œBitTorrent is too complicated, too centralized, and has bad incentives. LBRY solves the problem using blockchain technology, encryption, and a built-in marketplace.
The concept is simple. A content provider uploads a file to LBRY, and the file is chopped up, encrypted, and distributed to a network of hosts. The metadata for the file (title, location, etc.) is stored on a blockchain. Users can then pay the providers and hosts to decrypt the file and download or stream it. Payment happens through LBRY's native altcoin, called œLBRY credits, which is also what is mined to create the blockchain which stores the metadata.
I attended a live preview demonstration hosted by Kauffman to see LBRY in action. The LBRY desktop client looks clean and simple. The user (LBRY calls them œpatrons, while content providers are œpublishers) types the name of the content they want into a search field, which looks like a website URL but starts with œlbry://. In this demo, Kauffman typed in lbry://wonderfullife and It's a Wonderful Life instantly launched in his VLC video player. I asked if it would be that easy with the actual application when it launches, and was assured that's all there is to it. The one difference is that the film will have a price in LBRY credits that will be deducted from the user's wallet.
You might wonder, as I did, how they get the name œwonderfullife to point to the right film. This is all done through a bidding system that might be familiar to our Georgist readers. Basically you have to pledge a certain amount of credits to have a name point to your content “ and you can always be outbid. The LBRY team hopes this will result in the names being allocated efficiently through market processes.
But I think the real innovation here is LBRY's native alt-currency, which allows patrons to pay publishers directly, at the moment the content is exchanged. This completely cuts out middlemen, connecting content providers directly to their audience. Hosts also get paid, which incentivizes a stable decentralized network “ quite different from torrents, where you have to hope there are enough charitable seeders for what you want to download.
Chapman was widely regarded as an engineering genius, a man whose ability to push beyond conventional thinking created some of the most significant grand prix cars of all time.

Under his stewardship Lotus were always innovating “ and not just on the technical side. They were the first team to abandon national colours and paint their cars in a sponsor's livery. Their black and gold JPS colours would become among the most iconic in Formula 1 history.

But there was also a darker side to the team. Chapman's cars seemed to fit into one of two categories: incredibly fast, or incredibly fast but apt to fall apart.
The former brought world championships at a prodigious rate “ a combined 16 drivers' and constructors' titles in 15 years “ but the latter could have tragic results. The team was rocked by a number of driver fatalities, including big names like Jim Clark, Ronnie Peterson and Ricardo Rodriguez. Not all were the result of failures, but death seemed to stalk Lotus more than their rivals.

Nevertheless, during the glory years drivers were still desperate to get their hands on one of Chapman's cars. While they could be fragile, they were also brilliantly innovative and as such offered a fantastic shot at world championship glory.
Emerson Fittipaldi was one of many great drivers to pilot Team Lotus machinery. | Â© Peter Darley
Gone but not forgotten, here is how the Team Lotus story unfolded.
EARLY SUCCESSES
Unlike many of his contemporaries, who would purchase a car from a constructor and run it under their own banner, Chapman's outfit existed to design and build their own machinery.
Innes Ireland scored the first podium and victory for Team Lotus. | Sutton Images
After moving through the junior ranks the team arrived in F1 during the 1958 season. In 1960 Innes Ireland steered a Lotus 18 to runner-up spot at the Dutch Grand Prix, one of three podiums for the Yorkshireman that year on his way to fourth in the world championship.

Meanwhile the team's new driver, a 24-year-old Scot named Jim Clark, recorded his first top-three at the Portuguese Grand Prix.

Ireland would earn another first in 1961 when he won the U.S. Grand Prix aboard a Lotus 21. This represented the first race victory for Chapman's team.
But it was not the first Lotus car to win a grand prix. Stirling Moss had already claimed that distinction by triumphing at Monaco in 1960, piloting a Lotus 18 run by Rob Walker's privateer outfit. In fact, by the time Ireland won for Team Lotus, Chapman's cars had already won four grands prix.

But from this moment on the spotlight would be trained squarely on Team Lotus.
TRIUMPH & TRAGEDY
For 1962 Chapman had created the Lotus 25, one of the most significant cars in Formula 1 history thanks to its fully stressed monocoque chassis.
The brilliant young Clark was entrusted with the 25 for the 1962 season and used it to great effect, taking six poles from nine world championship events and winning three grands prix.

Poor reliability cost him the title as Clark was forced to retire in Monaco, France, Italy and South Africa. On each occasion he had started from pole and set the fastest lap.
But when the kinks were ironed out the combination of Clark and the Lotus 25 became unstoppable. In 1963 the Scotsman won seven times from 10 races and was only off the podium once. Clark and Lotus had their first world title.

Halfway through the 1964 season the team introduced the 33. As with its predecessor there were flashes of potential, but it would be the following season before it really showed its brilliance.

Once again Clark used a refined car to great effect, winning six times to secure another dominant world title.
The team even had time to skip the Monaco Grand Prix and instead contest the Indy 500. They won America's biggest race to firmly establish Chapman and Clark as the world's foremost designer and driver.
Chapman had the audacity to take on the Indy 500, and the brilliance to come away with the victory. | Sutton Images
The 33 was still being used in 1966 while the new Lotus 43 was developed. Clark only finished once in the new car that season, winning at the U.S. Grand Prix, but the campaign was not a success.
In 1967 the disappointing 43 was replaced by the brilliant Lotus 49. Clark won four times “ including the final two races of the season “ to finish third in the world championship. Hopes were high of another title-winning year in 1968.
Clark and Team Lotus defined an era of Formula 1. | Â© The Cahier Archive 2017
It was not to be. Clark won the 1968 season-opener but was killed driving for Lotus in an F2 race at Hockenheim. The man who many consider to be Britain's most naturally gifted driver of all time was gone.

Chapman's outfit quickly regrouped. New team leader Graham Hill won the two grands prix following Clark's death and secured the title with victory at the season finale in Mexico. Lotus had quickly shifted from tragedy to triumph.
1968 had brought another significant change: Imperial Tobacco came on board as sponsors and painted the car in the colours of their Gold Leaf brand, the first deal of its kind in F1.

1969 saw the brilliant young Austrian Jochen Rindt join the team and score his first win at the U.S. Grand Prix, but in 1970 triumph became tragedy. Rindt led the team's assault and was armed with another brilliantly innovative car, the Lotus 72, which pioneered side-mounted radiators and eventually the overhead air intake.

Car and driver were imperious. When he got the new-spec 72 at the Dutch Grand Prix Rindt began a four-race winning streak.

But tragedy struck at Monza when Rindt crashed during qualifying. The Lotus was running without wings so as to reduce drag and Rindt went off heavily at Parabolica. He died on his way to hospital.

Such was Rindt's advantage that he was still crowned world champion at the season's end, but for Lotus is was a tainted victory.
Once again the team began to rebuild, this time around Brazilian star Emerson Fittipaldi who took Lotus' first win following Rindt's death.

Their next triumph came in 1972 when the young Fittipaldi beat Jackie Stewart to the title in the JPS-livered Lotus 72. In 1973 the combination of Emmo and Swedish ace Ronnie Peterson gave Lotus the constructors' title, while both men were close to Stewart in the drivers' standings.

Fittipaldi departed and Lotus struggled over the next few years, despite the best efforts of the gifted Peterson, but began to recover when Mario Andretti joined in 1976.

1978 was another case of triumph and tragedy. Andretti scored six wins on his way to the world title, while Peterson “ who had returned from two years away from Lotus “ bagged a pair of victories to finish as runner-up.
But at the Italian Grand Prix Peterson became involved in a crash that was not of his making. Initially his injuries seemed serious though not life threatening, but the Swede suffered a fatal embolism in hospital. F1 was left stunned.

LIFE AFTER CHAPMAN
Lotus remained semi-competitive over the next few seasons, but their only win between 1979 and 1984 came when Elio de Angelis won the Austrian Grand Prix in 1982.
In truth, the team could never be the same after 16 December 1982. On the day that Lotus were testing the first active suspension car, Chapman suffered a fatal heart attack at his home in Norwich. He was 54 but had packed several lifetimes into one, from the glory of world championships to the strain of fatal accidents and the 24-hour schedule he seemed to keep.
Chapman's death came before a legal case regarding the DeLorean scandal, which a judge later said would have led to significant jail time for the Lotus founder. | Sutton Images
Chapman was replaced at the top by Peter Warr, who had long held senior positions within the team. But while Warr was the natural successor, he could not combine several roles as Chapman had.

The team continued to field talented drivers after Chapman's death, including De Angelis and Nigel Mansell, but the closest Lotus came to recapturing the glory years was during the three seasons that Ayrton Senna drove their cars.

The brilliant young Brazilian was signed for 1985 and won only his second race with the team in torrential rain at Estoril. He won once more in Belgium on his way to fourth in the world championship, which he matched in 1986.
He went one better in 1987, finishing third in the standings, but it was clear that Senna was headed for bigger things. Lotus no longer met that description and for 1988 he was snapped up by McLaren.

TERMINAL DECLINE
Senna was replaced by fellow countryman and three-time world champion Nelson Piquet, who scored three podiums in 1988 but none the following year when Honda power was replaced by Judd. His third-place at the 1988 Australian Grand Prix was Team Lotus' 172nd and last podium in F1.
Piquet's career was winding down when he joined Lotus, though the Brazilian did score three podiums in 1988. | Sutton Images
Thereafter the team declined into mediocrity. The Lamborghini-powered 1990 car was woefully uncompetitive, scoring just three points, and was the last to feature the tobacco sponsorship that Lotus had helped to pioneer in the sport.
1991 and 1992 at least brought a stellar driver line-up as future world champion Mika Hakkinen paired with future race winner Johnny Herbert. The Finn was particularly impressive in 1992 and helped Lotus to fifth in the constructors' standings.

But this was the last hurrah as Mika left for McLaren at the season's end. Herbert scored the team's final points at Spa in 1993, the same circuit where they recorded their first 35 years earlier.
The Mugen-Honda-powered 1994 car was uncompetitive and the team were all but broke, leading them to field five different drivers alongside Herbert. None managed any points and the team was wound up at the season's end.

THE SINCEREST FORM OF FLATTERY
In the years that followed rumours seemed to forever be circulating that Team Lotus could be revived. In 2010 that finally came to pass when Malaysian entrepreneur Tony Fernandes used the name and British racing green colour scheme for his new grand prix team.
But the situation descended into farce in 2011 when the former Renault squad were bought by an investment firm who held the rights to the name and decided to use the classic JPS livery. Eventually Fernandes' team became Caterham while the former Renault squad raced as Lotus F1 Team until 2015.

Of course, neither was really Lotus and fans knew it. The operation that Chapman founded was about innovation and doing things differently. Using the name of a team from the past would never have crossed the mind of a man who saw so much potential in the future.
In truth, Team Lotus and Colin Chapman could not exist apart. Â© Peter Darley

In the wake of the United States Anti-Doping Agency's (USADA) investigation into 'the most sophisticated, professionalised and successful doping programme that sport has ever seen', Dutch financial institution Rabobank has withdrawn its long-standing support of its top-level cycling team, and Skins, a clothing manufacturer and international cycling sponsor, has launched a UKÂ£1.25 million action against the sport's global governing body, the UCI.
But away from the eye of the storm, the commercial future looks bright for cycling, as indicated by a spate of recent cycling deals involving major international sports rights agencies.
IMG, the global media company that currently promotes the Tour de Suisse, is believed to be on the verge of announcing a three-year deal that would see it sell international broadcast rights to the major one-day races that fall under the 'Flanders Classics' corporate umbrella, namely the Omloop Het Neuwsblad, Dwars Door Vlaanderen, Gent-Wevelgum, Scheldeprijs, Brabantse Pijl, and the Ronde Van Vlaanderen, where a route change this year was undertaken with commercial growth in mind.
Ioris Francini, IMG's incredibly astute head of sales, clearly sees growth potential in top-level cycling, having sealed a long-term deal with RCS Sport for the Giro d'Italia and other major Italian races earlier in the year.
Francini was certainly busy at the recent Sportel sports broadcast rights market in Monaco.
As was Nicole Gruber, the UCI's commercial manager who has just put pen to paper on a landmark deal of her own. Infront Sports & Media, another agency titan, signed a four-year media rights deal for the UCI's major events in September.
While the financial details have not been revealed, Infront, which exploits the commercial potential of Swiss Cycling through a joint venture called InfrontRingier and is due to take over the promotion of the Tour de Suisse from IMG in 2015, has guaranteed the UCI a significant increase on its previous distribution deal with the EBU.
It is not just the major Europe-based agencies that are scrabbling for cycling. Total Sports Asia (TSA), which has offices in Malaysia, Singapore, China and India, also sees the sport as a potential growth area, an endorsement, in itself, of the sport's collective effort to grow internationally of late.
"We've gone a bit into cycling now, which seems to be, funnily enough, a flavour of the month for some of the other agencies as well," TSA chief executive Marcus Luer told SportsPro during Sportel in October.
"It seems to be a bit of a hot sport"
"We have looked at it for quite a while, done a few deals already and now you see Infront in it, IMG coming in “ I guess we all had the same idea that there is an opportunity.
The move comes after City Link was put into administration on Christmas Day and management announcing that ˜substantial' redundancies would be made on New Year's Eve,
œWe want to be very clear that we hold the people who work for us in utter contempt, said Joe Moulton, founder of City Link's parent company
œSorry, did I say ˜work?' I meant ˜worked,' obviously.
Plans to personally kick every employee in the shins and give them a Chinese burn were abandoned for logistical reasons.
However, there are unconfirmed reports that the management have been round to a number of employees' houses and had an enormous  ***  without flushing afterwards.

The Government have been quick to respond to the City Link plans.
œYes, not really our business, said Chancellor George Osborne
œAlthough, can't help thinking that if their employees had worked a bit harder, it wouldn't have come to this.
News of these further plans to abuse its workforce will trouble those who have criticised the company for the timing of its initial announcements.

John Kasich wants to set up no-fly zones for Syria because of Russia's air strikes in the war-ravaged middle-eastern nation.
"Russia's recent military build-up and intervention in Syria are neither intended to defeat ISIS nor to relieve the suffering of Syrian refugees. Mr. (Vladimir) Putin's real goals are quite different: to take military action to rescue assad's criminal government from its death and to strengthen Russia's strategic position in the Eastern Mediterranean. This is unacceptable and must stop,"the GOP presidential candidate will say in a statement Friday, according to Reuters.
The Ohio governor expresses concern that Saudi Arabia will now launch attacks because of Russia's military action.
"To prevent further escalation and suffering by civilians and refugees, the U.S. and its regional and West European allies need to establish sanctuary areas in Syria that are protected by 'no fly zones,' " Kasich's statement says, the news agency reports.
Christopher Soghoian is security and privacy blogger and it's because of this area of expertise that Facebook's PR firm, Burson-Marsteller, singled him out to write up a story attacking Google and their Circles. The PR firm even went as far as telling Soghoian that if he was œtoo busy to write up the story, they would do him the favor of writing one for him, all he would have to do is sign his name on the by line.
The PR firm also approached 3 other privacy researchers promising them front page stories in high profile news venues like The Washington Post but even then, they couldn't find anyone to bite. Soghoian, who was worried someone would eventually take them up on their offer, published the emails on his blog and appeared on Bloomberg West so that no one would be able to discredit him.
It's also worth mentioning that although Burson-Marstellar wouldn't disclose exactly who was funding them but apparently the owner of The Washington Post just so happens to be on the board of Facebook. That should be enough to make you scratch your chin.
I can tell you that we get emails all the time by PR agencies asking us to review or cover their product but nothing along these lines. What do you guys think? Is all fair in love and social networking? Or will this latest stunt have you immediately deleting your Facebook profile and heading for Google+'s greener pastures?
Today, I aim to introduce you to a gentleman who was as much a marital prize as was his wife, namely Richard FitzAlan, son and heir to Edmund FitzAlan, 9th Earl of Arundel, and Alice de Warenne. There are uncertainties as to when our young hero saw the light of the day, some advocating 1306, others 1313. These days, the majority seem to lean towards 1306 “ but given future events it would have suited Richard to put forward a later birthdate. More of that later.
Richard grew up in turbulent times. After the death of Edward I, the political stability in England went downhill, this due to the inexperience of the new king coupled with Edward II's penchants for favouritism. Plus things weren't made easier by a decade of bad harvests, the constant Scottish issue (to some extent sorted by Bannockburn) and the unrest on Ireland. And then, of course, there was the matter of Hugh Despenser, the king's favourite from 1318 or so. Our Hugh was good at alienating the other barons, most of whom regarded him as a greedy megalomaniac “ a characteristic he probably had in common with quite a few of his peers.
Anyway: Richard's father had originally sided with the barons who protested against Edward II's dependency on Piers Gaveston. In fact, the 9th Earl of Arundel took an active part in the rebellions that ended with Piers' death in 1312. However, in the coming years the earl grew closer to his king, and by the time Despenser took centre stage, Arundel was firmly in the royal party. To further cement his position, in 1321 Arundel married his son and heir “ Richard “ to the eldest Despenser daughter, Isabel. The happy couple was fifteen (or eight, if we go for the later birthdate for Richard) and nine respectively.
At the time, the wedding made perfect political sense. Edward II was inordinately fond of Hugh, and whoever the king preferred ended up with the juicer appointments. Obviously, Arundel hoped that his son would benefit from his close association with Despenser. Nothing at the time indicated that Despenser would soon be out on his ear, and the king enjoyed ruddy good health, so his reign was expected to be long and happily dominated by Hugh Despenser.
What the newlyweds thought of each other was neither here nor there. I imagine Richard as sullen and angry at being obliged to marry a girl so much his junior. Isabel was probably intimidated by the adolescent youth “ but her husband stood in line to becoming one of the wealthiest men in England, heir not only to the Arundel estates but also, through his mother, to the Earldom of Surrey seeing as John de Warenne, Richard's uncle, was a victim of a loveless marriage and lived estranged from his wife.
The years 1322- 1326 were disruptive, with the king and Despenser fighting a losing battle against the growing opposition among the king's barons. Having the queen, Isabella of France, side with the rebels did not help. Having Roger Mortimer and Isabella invade England with the young Prince Edward, heir to the throne, at their side, definitely nailed down the coffin on the Despenser -Edward II act. Suddenly, being married to a Despenser was not so much a good thing¦
In November of 1326 both Arundel and Hugh Despenser met their deaths. Arundel was supposedly executed with a blunt sword “ a cruel and extended death “ while Hugh's death was made into a gory spectacle. Young Richard was suddenly the earl “ except that he wasn't, as his father was attainted, and so Richard FitzAlan was hastily reduced to a nobody and was obliged to flee the country.
At the time, his wife Isabel was pregnant, and was delivered of a son in 1327. Being married saved Isabel from the fate of her three younger sisters, who in a cruel act of vengeance were forced to become nuns, this despite their youth (they were approximately eleven, nine and seven when they took the veil). It did not save her from being viewed askance “ anyone related to Despenser was suspect, and Isabel's mother, Eleanor de Clare, was held in the Tower while her older brother was under siege at Caerphilly Castle.
In 1330, Edward III took control of his kingdom. Mortimer was executed, Queen Isabella was relegated to the background, and Richard FitzAlan returned to England and petitioned the king for his hereditary lands and income. Edward graciously reinstated Richard as the Earl of Arundel in 1331, and one would assume our hero, by now all of twenty-five or so, would take the opportunity to further populate his nursery “ after all, his wife was clearly fertile.
No such attempts seem to have been made. Nor does Richard appear to have been all that interested in his son, little Edmund. Instead, the new Earl of Arundel invested his considerable energies and capabilities in serving his king. A competent leader of men, Arundel proved his worth in war as well as diplomacy, and from 1334 and onwards, one office after the other landed in his lap. Being one of the richer barons in England and blessed with a well-developed sense of business which further increased his wealth, Arundel was also in a position to offer financial services to the king. Such loans did not generate any income “ the Church frowned on usury “ but they came with other rewards, such as the king's support in various matters.
Most of the 1330s Richard spent harrying Scotland on behalf of his king. Come the 1340s, and he was instead to be found in France, an active participant at CrÃ©cy. In between these martial endeavours, it seems Richard also fallen in love. Unfortunately, not with his wife¦
The woman who had caught Richard's eye was Eleanor of Lancaster. A widow in her mid-twenties, this lady came without the Despenser stigma. She was also the mother of a son, thereby indicating she was fertile. Perfect wife material “ or so Richard thought “ and it helped that he seems to have been genuinely in love with her. Problem was, Isabel was still alive. Very much so, in fact, and showing no tendencies to helpfully roll over and die anytime soon.
A man as rich as Richard could afford to set his wife up in her own household, far from his. I therefore imagine that Isabel and Richard rarely saw each other, and maybe they were both content to live their separate lives. Isabel may have resented being excluded from the heady life at court “ Richard would have had no desire to parade his Despenser wife “ but she was financially secure and the mother of Richard's heir. If her husband preferred the company of other ladies, there was little she could do but pretend not to notice, and at first his infatuation with Eleanor may have appeared as just an illicit little tryst. Soon enough, it became apparent that Richard had other plans for Eleanor.
Eleanor was of royal blood (as was Isabel), her father the grandson of Henry III (Not so sure that is much to brag about, but still¦) In the early 1340s, the earl of Lancaster was old “ and blind “ but he was a powerful magnate and he wasn't about to tolerate his daughter living in sin, no matter how much she may have loved her paramour. Richard couldn't agree more.
So, in 1344, Richard FitzAlan petitioned the pope, asking that he annul his marriage to Isabel Despenser. More than twenty years after the wedding, he now admitted to having been coerced into it “ both he and his wife had been too young to be able to consent “ and that œby force of blows he'd been forced to cohabit with her. Their son was not the result of a loving union, rather the fruit of an enforced bedding.
œHmm, said the pope, raising a sceptical eyebrow. This is when loaning the king all that money came in useful. Edward III added his voice to Richard's, as did Lancaster, and soon enough the pope produced an annulment “ and the dispensation Richard needed to marry Eleanor, seeing as she was Isabel's first cousin.
Just like that, Isabel was no longer the Countess of Arundel. Instead, she was a woman who'd borne a child out of wedlock “ a fallen woman, no less. What she may have thought of all this is unknown, but it doesn't take all that much imagination to picture just how humiliated she must have felt. Unfortunately for Isabel, she had no powerful male relatives to fight her corner. She had no choice but to accept the settlement offered by Richard “ six manors at her disposal for the rest of her life.
As to Isabel's son, Edmund, the annulment made him illegitimate. The seventeen-year-old who'd grown up believing himself to be the heir to the Arundel and Surrey lands was now, with little to his name but what his father might deign to give him. Richard must have given Edmund something “ as evidenced by the fact that Edmund went on to marry a younger daughter of the Earl of Salisbury “ but it was probably a pittance compared to what Edmund had stood to inherit. I guess the father-son relationship never recovered¦ Actually, occasionally I wonder if there may have been question marks regarding Edmund's paternity “ how else to explain Richard's callous treatment of his firstborn? Or maybe it was a prerequisite for his marriage to Eleanor, that the son from his first marriage be*** ised so as to ensure it was Eleanor's children who inherited the titles. Whatever the case, poor Edmund and his mother were out on their ear.
Richard and Eleanor went on to have a long and fruitful marriage. Soon enough, the pitter-patter of small feet echoed over the massive floorboards of Arundel Castle, as first Richard junior, then a further half-dozen of sons and daughters were born. I imagine Richard was content: his career flourished, his wealth increased exponentially “ when he died, he was the richest man around “ and he had both an heir and a spare. On top of all this, he had his Eleanor. By all accounts, theirs was a loving relationship “ as demonstrated by the beautiful “ and inspiring, ask Philip Larkin “ memorial to them in Chichester Cathedral where they lie, side by side, holding hands through eternity. If we're going to be precise, though, it's only their effigies that hold hands “ their bodily remains were interred in Lewes Priory.
Isabel never got an effigy. She sort of faded into obscurity. Despite determined efforts, Edmund never succeeded to his father's wealth and title and died a bitter and angry man. He could, I suppose, comfort himself with that he, in difference to his much younger half-brother, died with his head still attached to his body. Somehow, I don't think it helped.
